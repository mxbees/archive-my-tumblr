honestly. you know what i spent a bunch of time trying to research?

anything that did comparisons between the east indes and west indes.

from everything i've learned so far, pilipinxs would be much better off 

looking towards caribbean/west indian scholarship

re: parsing identity in complex, liminal space

where many of the mostly firm boundaries are fuzzy and become incoherent.

and if i had the time/energy/money and desire to go back to school...

this is actually probably what i'd research.

do a comparative analysis of the spanish east and west indes.

(i'm also writing this in the hope someone else will be inspired and do the research)
