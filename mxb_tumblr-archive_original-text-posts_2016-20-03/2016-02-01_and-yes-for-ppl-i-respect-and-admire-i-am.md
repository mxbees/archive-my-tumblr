and yes. for ppl i respect and admire, i am totally willing to explain myself.

not necessarily 'discuss' (esp. not in a situation where i think both of us are right).

anyway. bc i'm a fan of meta-discourse, i'm generally enjoying this particular engagement.

(and now i wonder how many ppl are going to think i'm a pretentious ass for using 'meta-discourse' in non-ironic fashion... but i hope ppl realize that a *lot* of my posts are situated within 'meta-discourse'. see the tag: 'discussing discourse' which is the literal definition of what meta-discourse is)
