actually. I know why. bc it'll be low maintainance and I really like that idea. 
since I don't have to worry about looking professional anymore,  i'm really thinking I would should aim for maximum coziness. 

like. just keep my head shaved. wear a hoodie with the hood up all the time. or wear a scarf on my head if I want to be extra femme. 

only wear lipstick and just abandon foundation. do my nails super nice bc i do like that. 

get some face piercings. keep up with my tattooing. maybe tattoo my head since it'll be shaved all the time. 

wear jogging pants and oversized shirts bought from thrift stores with the necks and sleeves cut off.

keep getting fat.

then die miserable and alone. 

but i'll fucking have tits.
