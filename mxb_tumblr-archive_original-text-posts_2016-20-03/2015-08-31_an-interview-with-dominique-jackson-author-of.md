title: An Interview with Dominique Jackson - Author of _The Transsexual From Tobago_
---
This is an interview with Dominique Jackson, a trans woman from Trinidad and Tobago. She recently published a memoir title _The Transsexual From Tobago_ ([find it on amazon][1]). She also recently appeared in the documentary _My Truth, My Story_ produced by The Caribbean Equality Project.

There are a lot of great answers here but perhaps my favourite:

>**What shall define your legacy?**

>My resilience, perseverance and strength.
