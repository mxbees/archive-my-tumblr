here's a media trope i don't like:

in my current book, they repeat the oft expressed idea that

'nothing good comes easy'

in reference to romance, love, relationships

can like ppl stop perpetuating the idea that ~true love~ is a hardship?

that the best relationships are difficult and hard?

love does not have to be challenging to be meaningful or real.

does. not.

love can be easy. maybe the easiest thing in the world.

relationships can be easy. same with romance. 

maybe this isn't the stuff of epic poetry

but it is real and it is possible.
