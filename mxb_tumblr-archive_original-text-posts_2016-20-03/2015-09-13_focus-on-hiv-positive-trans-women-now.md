title: Focus on HIV Positive Trans Women Now
---
I actually can't believe that there is an entire article by (I think) a white trans woman wherein I disagree with nothing.

The only thing I'm iffy about is her sharing a twoc's story. I'm hoping that she secured permission before doing so.

But here are the recommendations she makes:

>  LGBT activists needs to care about the alarmingly high rate of HIV among trans women and push our organizations, political leaders and the pharmaceutical industry to do so as well. Silence can still equal death for trans people who can’t access medical care. It’s time to remind everyone of this.

> • The research/medical community and pharmaceutical industry needs to stop misgender-ing trans women in research studies. Lumping trans women into studies about “men who have sex with men” does not give you true statistics on trans women’s needs and risks, making it difficult for concerned clinicians to properly treat trans women with HIV. We need them to ensure that trans people are properly categorized in future research.

> • Medical schools and medical organizations need to start training their people to treat transgender patients properly and mandating that people do so. Refusing care to people because of their gender identity is a travesty.

> • We need to elevate trans people into leadership areas in HIV organizations, including their voices when we talk about HIV.

> • We need LGBT organizations to take up the mantle in talking about trans people and HIV, and we need trans organizations to tackle HIV. One such organization is doing just that: The Transgender Law Center has created Positively Trans, a project led by a group of poz trans people who have launched the first-of-its-kind study seeking to determine the obstacles to care faced by trans people living with HIV.

I mean. I've said the same myself. Especially concerning the fact that many researchers lump trans women in with 'men who have sex with men'.
