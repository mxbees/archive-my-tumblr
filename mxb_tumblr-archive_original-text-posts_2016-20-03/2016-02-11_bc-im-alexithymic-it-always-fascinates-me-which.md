bc i'm alexithymic

it always fascinates me which topics manage to elicit a noticeable emotional response from me

like. why does white environmentalists telling me i need to die to save the planet manage to evoke a noticeable emotional reponse?

in general, i'm not a fan of white ppl telling me that i need to die.

and most times, when told this, my emotional response is 'meh'

until the reason is that i need to save the planet. 

then i'm like

'how fucking dare you'
