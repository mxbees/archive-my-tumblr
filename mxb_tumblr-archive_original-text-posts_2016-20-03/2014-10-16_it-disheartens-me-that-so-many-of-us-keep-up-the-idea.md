title: It disheartens me that so many of us keep up the idea that some deserve protection
  and some don't.

<p>And that this idea is always, always grounded in some behaviour policing garbage.</p>&#13;
<p>That only if you do <em>x</em>, will you avoid dire fate <em>y</em>.</p>&#13;
<p>When it is clear that the value of <em>x</em> is usually 0 and nothing can stop some people from hurting you.</p>&#13;
<p>But somehow the discussion is always what is the value of <em>x</em> such that <em>x</em> &gt; 0 that will suddenly cause people to care about you and to think you are worth protecting.</p>&#13;
<p>Because some victims are always to blame and will never deserve protection.</p>
