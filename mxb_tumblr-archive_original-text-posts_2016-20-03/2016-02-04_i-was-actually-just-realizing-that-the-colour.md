i was actually just realizing that the colour issue is actually one where white ppl have non-Black poc beat.

i mean. at least when they ask asinine questions like 'why isn't there a white history month?'

they are at least picking the correct analogous race (hint: W H I T E)

but when non-Black poc do it?

we always say stuff like 'asian' or whatever.

like. if u have to ask a shitty anti-Black question, at least make it accurate

'why isn't there a yellow history month?' = correct equivalence

'why isn't there an asian history month?' = i'm not only anti-Black but ignorant about the history of racism
