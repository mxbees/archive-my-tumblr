apparently my insomnia has decided to intensify for the winter break, which is a nice treat i guess.

as it stands, i haven't had a night of uninterrupted sleep for four (five?) months now. atm, my brain-body has decided that on top of periodically waking up while i'm sleeping, that i should also start waking up (again) around 4. plus the sleep apnea issue.

the sleep interruptions started when i started prozac, so i'm still blaming that.

however, waking up super early and not being able to sleep again until night is something that usually goes along with being depressed.

which is worrisome, since things have been fairly stable/okay for the past two or so months. guess i'll wait and see how things play out over the next little while. i'm really really hoping that the early wakeups are just a little blip and i can go back to the status quo of one kind of insomnia + sleep disorder.

also fun is that my IBS has been kind of brutal for the past few days. lots of cramping. i think mainly bc i've only taken very very small poops for like, four days or something. my input is far exceeding my output. 

fuck. i'm so tired. i dont' think i actually meant to write about this. but i can't really think.
