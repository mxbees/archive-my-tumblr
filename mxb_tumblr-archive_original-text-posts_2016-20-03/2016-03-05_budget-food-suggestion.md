i was very surprised to learn that parboiled rice has about 80% of the nutrients of brown rice.

i used to make fun of it bc its what i know as 'white ppl rice' but i've been buying it bc its cheaper than jasmine, basmati, brown, and other kinds of rice (usually one of the cheapest -- like an 8kg bag for $7 or something like that).

anyway. parboiled rice is a good way to increase the nutritional value of your rice and it reduces costs. it also isn't... as texturally unpleasant as brown rice (it actually has, for me, a pleasant chewiness). 

just... fyi.
