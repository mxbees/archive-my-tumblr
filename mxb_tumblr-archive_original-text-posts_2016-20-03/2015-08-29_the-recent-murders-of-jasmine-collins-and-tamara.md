  community worried

>Two recent murders in Kansas City have many around the country questioning whether or not the metro is safe for transgender people.

>Gibbs said this rise could partly be due to more transgender people coming out.

>“Transgender people, especially transgender women, are more visible now ... They’re becoming more integrated into the fabric of society ... and in doing so, they become victimized.”

###Commentary

I sort of wanted to quote that last part because this is clearly a lie. Given how, in the past month alone, I think there have been two or three murders re-classified as being against twoc. With local communities identifying the 'male' victims of certain crimes as actually being trans women.

The overall numbers for this year would be artificially lower if these incidents hadn't been caught and reclassified. More than likely the 'increase' of twoc murders is about more awareness and ability of local community members to pressure the media and police into correctly identifying victims.

The reality is, is that it is more likely that twoc murders have been and are much higher because of this misidentification. In some of the stories from _this year_ we have police officials outright saying they will not identify a trans woman as a woman and all their documents misgender her.
