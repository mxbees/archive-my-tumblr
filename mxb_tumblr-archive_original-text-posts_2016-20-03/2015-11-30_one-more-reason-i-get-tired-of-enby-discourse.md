title: one (more) reason i get tired of enby discourse
---
Having this discussion with another twoc right now about how we have two options for when we go outside:

1. Spend time to put on makeup. Even if it is to go to the store for fifteen minutes and two blocks away.
2. Or go without and be misgendered.

And... yet. Every single time I have to read a thinkpiece by some enby (white and poc, afab and dfab), the discussion is still frame as:

"Hey, there are like, TWO, famous Black trans women. And like a famous white one. But all this visibility hasn't helped me, an enby. Visibily gender non-conforming people matter too! And we have to deal with erasure and misgendering and hostility on a daily basis."

I honestly usually stop reading after the first paragraph for most of these articles. Its all the same.

And its so B O R I N G.

Uninspired.

This despite the fact that Laverne Cox has said she gets clocked all the time. She is 'visibly gender non-conforming'.

But some enbies are too busy going 'what about me???' to actually pay attention. You don't have to think Laverne Cox 'represents' you as an enby. But claiming that gender non-conformity is somehow limited or unique to enbies is simply wrong. And irritating.

(For the record, I *am* one of the 'visibly gender non-conforming' enbies that I'm talking about here. This is, in fact, my life. And yet...)
