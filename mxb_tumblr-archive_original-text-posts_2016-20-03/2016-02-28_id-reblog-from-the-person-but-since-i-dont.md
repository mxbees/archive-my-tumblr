(i'd reblog from the person but since i don't really do that anymore in case of splash over harassment...)

u know what the absolute saddest thing is about writing about activist(tm) community dynamics and the coercive and abusive processes?

seeing how many people see their own experiences being described.

this reminds me that i wanted to write a blog post about 'activist attrition'

and how... so many ppl just quietly (sometimes not so quietly) disappear from these space. i think i know more ppl who've been alienated and exiled from Activism(tm) than actual Activists(tm)

it interests me that you can see a lot of discussion about getting new recruits, about outreach, about getting the message out.

but i literally cannot think of a single post or discussion that addresses the problem of attrition in ~social justice~. 

and this is distinct from burnout. these are the ppl who maybe weren't Leaders(tm) but they were dedicated. they showed up.

until they didn't.

haven't seen a single movement or community explore not only how they can stop alienating their own members, but how to maybe get some of them back.

but... near as i can tell. so many of the times, ppl just don't notice when ppl stop showing up. too caught up in the cause, in the petty in-fighting and politics. 

maybe one day at some nebulous future point they'll say, 'hey, remember b.? whatever happened to them?' everyone will shrug and life will go on.
