what i learned over the past year and a half

is that ppl will insist you kill yourself over purity

they'll try and tell you that they'll be there and they'll support u

they'll make u feel like ur a hero if you step up and out.

they'll cheer you on

but when the time comes

you find urself standing there.

alone.
