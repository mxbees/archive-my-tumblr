title: the state of trans, or get off my lawn
---
Just when I think I couldn't despise Dana Beyer more... I get to read an article like this. This article on the 'state of the trans community' where she spends pretty much the entire thing screaming at youth to get off her lawn and smile and nod while being dehumanized.

> I see this as the root of the "microaggression" and "trigger warning" campaigns on campus which I believe do more harm than good. Not only is it imperative that you don't take everything personally, it's critical that even when it is personal that you steel yourself and not respond in kind.

She's said as much before. But seriously? Stoicly endure violence as political praxis? That's ur fucking advice?

And then she gets to one of the most outright racist statements I've seen from her:

> We see trans persons of color continually attacked because the men in their community have not been affected by society's slowly changing mores. 

I see. It has come to this, it appears. Is this how white trans women are understanding the issue of violence and trans women of colour? Because 'Black on Black' crime? Because men of colour are more violent, regressive, and conservative?

>  The optimism of children and adolescents is understandable, as they have little sense of context and history, but even when you find community on the internet you cannot simply assume that your parents and peers will support you.

Translated: fucking kids these days. thinking that everyone and anyone should respect their humanity. don't u know the world isn't fair? :)

Bleh. Anyway. Here's one of 'our' leaders. Apparently, the expectation that ppl treat you like a human being is naive idealism and we should all wake up and accept being treated like trash. :D
