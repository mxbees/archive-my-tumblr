currently looking into the health info for beef vs pork vs chicken.

i looked at pork prices for the first time in forever the other day and was surprised to see how cheap it is compared to chick and beef.

i stopped eating pork a long time ago for religious reasons (that aren't relevant anymore but still make me hesistant to eat it)

but i think its time for me to get over it.

i need an affordable source of protein that i'm not allergic too, isn't expensive, and doesn't destroy my digestive system.

so. it looks like i'm going to start cooking with pork. for the first time ever.
