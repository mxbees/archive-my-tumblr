<p>i do think it is kind of interesting that the anon i had earlier formulates &#8216;ndn&#8217; as entirely restricted to north american even though&#8230;.</p>

<p>like. my people were called &#8216;indians&#8217; by the spanish anyway&#8230;.</p>

<p>but also the anti-Blackness&#8230; it still itches at my skin</p>

<p>even as, yes, i don&#8217;t get space &#8212; but i also wasn&#8217;t asking for it &#8212; in discussions of american Indigenous discourse.</p>
