<p>Really, the last thing I want is a gringx’s opinion in “third world”/”developing” countries. Including the terminology.</p>

<p>not only is she white<br /><br />but she is also one of those whites who get SUPER DEFENSIVE<br /><br />when ppl ask why they don’t make it clear that they are white.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m so unsurprised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Question: <br />What’s the alternative here? What would the desired course of action for a gringue?<br />Maybe saying something like “ok I’m white but I think ___”, or just not saying anything at all? Because keeping silent about these things, wouldn’t it be taken as, like, reinforcing the oppressive opinion?<br /><br />Help. I’m confused.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The alternative in a post like that one I reblogged is really to not say anything because a white settler&#8217;s opinion in terminology that applies mostly or completely to colonized countries WITHOUT including the voices of non-white people from said countries, is colonialist on itself.</p>
<p>Regarding stating her race on her description; if she&#8217;s still gonna keep talking about racial issues (Instead of amplifying the voices of poc talking about that), she should AT LEAST clarify that she&#8217;s white somewhere for accountability purposes.</p></blockquote>

<p>like. why could she (or any other white person) just link or quote to something and iaopoc person has said? <br/><br/>as far as racism and colonialism is concerned, white ppl have no original thoughts. it came from somewhere... so point, boost, and highlight. <br/><br/>and i really had to fucking _dig_ to find that post about her race. <br/><br/>"i've never tried to hide my race, except that if you actually try to find it, you'll have to look really really hard"<br/><br/>before i engage pretty much anyone i don't know about topics like racism or colonialism (fuck, actually any topic tbh, including trans stuff, sexuality, how to make muffins, whatever), i usually go check out the person's bio. <br/><br/>in general, i'm not on tumblr to have conversations with white ppl about anything. <br/><br/>whether or not someone is important information for us and our safety<br/><br/>and this is what needs to be prioritized</p>
