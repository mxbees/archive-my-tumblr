<p>i think next year&#8230; i may try organizing my own tdor thing. something super small but make it a potluck so we can provide a seriously awesome feast for the departed.</p>

<p>i&#8217;d want to make it entirely unlike any other tdor thing i&#8217;ve seen. idk.</p>

<p>we&#8217;ll see&#8230;</p>
