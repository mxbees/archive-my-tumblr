Since some anti-Black asians apparently feel like we are somehow prevented, by Black people, from discussing race or our views/perspectives are meaningless bc Black people... I figured I'd write a quick guide for discussing race as a non-Black asian without being a giant anti-Black shithead.

1. Write about race in relation to (non-Black) Asians.
2. Blame racism and white supremacy on **white** people.

Hmm... I think this is about it. 

Here's an example:

Chris Rock used Asian children as props to a joke invoking the stereotype of all asians being good at math. This was bad because stereotypes are bad. But also because using actual living children as props and as the butt of your joke is bad. He also made a joke about child labour in Asia, which is unfortunate because this is a serious issue and not really funny at all.

Or how about:

Its been x amount of years since any Asian was nominated for an oscar. And only x number have ever been nominated. Hollywood has a serious diversity problem and almost exclusively only tells stories about white people and celebrates white people. This is bad. Because representation in media is important. The oscars are racist. 

It's really not that hard.
