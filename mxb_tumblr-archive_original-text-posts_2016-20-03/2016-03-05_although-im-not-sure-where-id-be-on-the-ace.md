although. i'm not sure where i'd be on the ace spectrum.

the last time i spent anytime thinking about it, i think i'd decided on demi.

but i'm pretty sure that i am not that. 

if i cared more, maybe i'd do some digging to see whats popular with the kids these days.

but i don't really care at all.

salient facts: i basically never feel sexual desire/attraction. i enjoy having sex.
