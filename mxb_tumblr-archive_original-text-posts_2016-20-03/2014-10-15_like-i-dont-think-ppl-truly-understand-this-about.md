<p>like i don&#8217;t think ppl truly understand this about all the ppl who might be considered the Big Names in our little corner of tumblr</p>

<p>like.</p>

<p>my friends and the ppl i care about how have thousands of followers&#8230;</p>

<p>built this following by getting harassed, triggered, stalked, threatened, and so on.</p>

<p>all for talking about their lives</p>

<p>and trying to connect with ppl</p>

<p>and many have somewhat abandoned their platforms bc of above but also plagiarism, media exploitation, academic abuse and the like</p>

<p>(a lot of these ppl are Black/queer/trans)</p>

<p>this is really the formula for getting tumblr famous as a marginalized person:</p>

<ol><li>talk about your life 2. get harassed 3. respond to harassment instead of just letting ppl abuse them</li>
</ol><p>sure. making ~quality~ posts helps, but it isn&#8217;t enough.</p>

<p>i also know lots of ppl who make quality posts but don&#8217;t have a following bc they don&#8217;t do the other stuff.</p>

<p>the rage of the oppressed is theatre for our oppressors</p>

<p>our sorrow and tears their dessert</p>
