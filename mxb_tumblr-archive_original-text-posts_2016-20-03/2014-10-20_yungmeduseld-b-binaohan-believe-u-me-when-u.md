<p>ppl tell u every fucking day that u aren’t</p>

<p>And when you are white passing and people treat you badly, understand: they are treating you badly because they are associating you with the BROWN and BLACK people you share ancestry with, not your perceived whiteish race. See: white PoC/white people with PoC heritage or culture/ white ___race___ (white natives, white desis, jewish whites, white asians, middle eastern whites, ethnic whites, etc.).</p>
<p>Your problem is the radial hatred of the perception of your ancestors, not your own.</p>
