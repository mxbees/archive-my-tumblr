<p>TBH, I think it&rsquo;s your place to call out non-Black people on antiblackness at any time, anywhere. If they don&rsquo;t like it, maybe they should try not being antiblack. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not Indigenous, so you can&rsquo;t call out the antiblackness in this conversation about us that excludes Black people&rdquo; bitch that leaves just Black people to defend/fend for ourselves. Swerve hella to the left, to the left</p></blockquote>

<p>Ok. I'm going to trust you on this since.... Yeah.</p><p>It is interesting to me that I always get this when I'm talking about antiBlackness or defending Black ppl.</p><p>Just. Interesting.</p>
