Here's what you said:

> people who claim to be body positive, but then use that self proclaimed status as an excuse to then forcefully change their body, clearly are working at body posi 101

> body posi LITE if you will lol

> what you meant to say, is you believe in body autonomy, and being able to do whatever you want to your own body, which is fine, you do you

> but being body posi means loving your body as is, not changing it to look like some ridiculous beauty standard

i'm not sure i can fathom how you fail to see how this implicates trans ppl. especially when you mention 'ridiculous beauty standards'. 

i am a person who is, overall, pretty ok with my body as it (was).

i am also a person who has 'forcefully change'd my body to 'look like some ridiculous beauty standard'.

and now i like my body a lot less. perhaps enough so that i'd never, ever claim to be body positive.

to some extent, you are correct in that i probably shouldn't have bothered commenting on your post because it wasn't directed towards people like me. ppl who don't claim to be body positive and/or ppl who think body positivity is a garbage idea in general.

certainly, i am not a person who uses my self-proclaimed body positivity to forcefully change my body.

however, i did comment on the post because your post, your words, are sterling examples for why i think body positivity is a garbage idea and why people like u should go fuck themselves.

see? i didn't even put that in a tag.

here's another: i hope u fucking choke on ur body positivity.
