#The HRC hates trans women too

Buzzfeed just put out this [article about why the HRC is being defeated by trans bathroom panic][buzz]. The overall point of the article is that the HRC has yet to find any real response to the trans bathroom panic issue, much less a *good* one. And while it does include some historical context:

> But the larger problem, it appears, is that the modern LGBT rights movement was built around opposing anti-gay efforts — at the ballot and within government — and eventually winning on gay issues, particularly marriage equality.

> During that time, though, the big national groups invested comparatively little infrastructure or expertise into nurturing transgender issues. Moreover, they conducted less organization-building and education within conservative states — where marriage equality prevailed due to court rulings more than grassroots activism — even though those states lacked anti-discrimination laws.

The problem? This is too kind. One only needs to look at [Monica Robert's classic post, "Why the Transgender Community Hates HRC"][hrc] to get a better grasp of the real historical and political issues at play here. This attempt to contextualize the problem the HRC is having dealing with trans woman-related issues is far too neutral. I encourage everyone to read Monica Robert's post which concludes:

> In conclusion, the drama between the transgender community and HRC (which sadly flared up last week after Rep. Frank introduced a non-inclusive ENDA) is a forty-year-old stew flavored with historical hatred, arrogance, political miscalculations, communication failures, misunderstandings, mistrust, and Machiavellian duplicity. 

The history of problems between the HRC (and similar orgs) has literally been going on since trans women of colour started the fucking movement in the first place. Mere years after starting it, those very same leaders where pushed out and had their/our movement coopted. 

It isn't that the HRC and other gay rights orgs neglected trans issues or didn't make them a priority, it is that they have been working *against* us for decades. They cannot address the issue of trans bathroom panic and transmisogyny precisely because they *agree*. It has been part of their organizing strategy to sweep us under the rug so that they can appear more respectable and more assimilatable.

That's what a lot of people really don't get. Is that the gay strategy wasn't just about demystifying the whole gay thing and making teh gays human in hetero eyes, but it was a purposeful contrastive thing to show that they weren't deviants like trans women of colour. That they were normal and we are not. They they aren't predators but we very well could be. They deserve rights and protections because *we don't*.  This juxtaposition has been intentional in their organizing efforts for the past fifty-ish years.

As such, it isn't surprising that they cannot turn on a dime and suddenly be able to provide meaningful support to trans women. Especially not when [their own internal report][report] found that they are a gay, white men's club. Mind you, this isn't just a problem of the fact that they exclude trans women from the leadership (or really any meaningful roll within the organization), it is that this is literally how their entire organization has been structured from the beginning. They cannot effectivley mobilize against a position that they themselves hold and have been enforcing for the entire time their org (and its predeccesors) have existed.

#Trans bathroom panic is about trans *women*

Its amusing that both this article and the reported responses for the HRC and ACLU engage in precisely the same kind of transmisogyny that is killing non-discrimination ordinances all over the US. The ACLU is reported as saying:

> “We will do so by educating voters and helping them understand who transgender people are (i.e., NOT ‘men dressing up as women’), that they are not sexual predators... 

Who is this 'they'? 'Men in dresses' is trans women and has pretty much nothing to do with trans men. The opposition organizing under a banner of 'keep men out of women's restrooms' is organizing agaisnt *trans women*. This has very little (if anything) to do with trans men or 'trans people' in general[^envy]. The fact that they cannot grasp even this most basic of facts about the situation is why, by and large, they'll continue to fail at finding any meaningful counter-strategies. How could they if they don't even understand the problem?

#A note on the suggested strategies for disarming trans (woman) bathroom panic

##On the 'it hasn't happened yet' argument

The first suggested strategy was showing the facts that, in the US, there are zero examples of male predators using trans protections as a way to assault women. Of course, [I've written before about how this isn't true of Canada][actors]. And that this case *has already been used* as a way to prevent a trans rights bill from passing in Canada. This is an extremely perilous and flimsy counter-argument to the whole 'men in dresses in women's restrooms' issue.

Because what happens when this fact can no longer be asserted (as in Canada)? It isn't enough to point out that the accussed in the Canadian case wasn't, in fact, a trans woman. But the shelter's permissive policy about allowing self-identification is exactly what allowed him access to women. His actual gender identity is irrelevant. And since I wrote that post, I still haven't seen many (any tbh) responses for how this should be handled. 

##On the 'do ads to humanize trans women' argument

The next major strategy proposed in the buzzfeed article (via 'grassroots' activists) is this:

> Another defense: In TV ads, campaigns could feature transgender women who familiarize themselves to voters, show they’re not men, and explain that they use the bathroom to pee, not to prey.

Okay. They try to make parallels to effective strategies about focusing happy, loving gay couples as a way to show that we are all fluffy puppies who'll assimilate directly into the existing power structure. At the very end of the article an activist is quoted talking about having a 'trans face', a 'poster child'.

While some of the problems with this approach are shared by the gay marriage one (ie, a focus on 'normalizing' deviant behaviour via demonstrating a willingness to assimilate and not rock the boat), it again shows that most of these people are considering trans women to be another comparible class instance to cis gays or lesbians. But we aren't. And the strategies that worked before *will not* work for addressing transmisogyny and trans bathroom panic.

Why? Because cis gay and cis lesbian respectability was established using transmisogyny in the first place. Again, [read Monica Robert's blog post][hrc]. The cis gay and cis lesbian community has spent too much fucking time shoring up the belief that trans women are deviant and incapable of assimilation to backtrack on this now (even if this were a desirable strategy -- which it isn't). 

Beyond this, there's the problem of who gets to be the poster child. Obviously, if the goal is to show that we aren't 'men in dresses' the poster child will likely have to be the exact kind of trans woman that feminists accuse us all of being and hating us for it. Which will only serve to encourage people on the *left* to mobilize more forcefully against us too. 

On this account, this also demonstrates how very little these gay orgs actually understand of the current political/ideological climate of opposition to trans women. All these things that are being said by conservatives? Have been said by feminists and other people on the left for decades too. Transmisogyny is one of the few things that both the left and the right absolutely agree on. And, again, these orgs will fail unless they understand that the 'enemy' isn't just the religious right. The reason why opposition to trans women is so much more than 'expected' is because it isn't just conservatives who are willing to organize against us. And it isn't conservatives who've actively been working against us for *decades*. They are literally new entrants to this. 

I could get into how an assimilationist strategy will fail to address the actual issues facing trans women. But... this was also true of the gay assimilationist strategy, as this approach throws a lot of peole under the bus and should really be abandoned since it just defers and pushes this fight onto another more vulnerable group, rather than actually stopping the fight entirely.

[^envy]: But of course, transbr0 MRAs will be more than happy to claim that this hypervisibility is actually a 'privilege' and that they are being 'erased' from this all. To all of you? Go fuck yourselves.
