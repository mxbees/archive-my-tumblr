<p>is it just me or is this post extremely transmisogynist</p></blockquote>
I thought that this post was pretty okay considering the commenters said ‘people who menstruate’ not like ‘girls’ or even ‘people with vaginas’ like nobody said anything about gender, they were speaking specifically about sexual organs so idk??? Can someone send me an ask about this?</blockquote>

<p>The post originally said “women” and the second comment originally said “guys”. So. No</p></blockquote>

<p>Still transmisogynist...</p><p>'ppl with dicks' indicates trans women have free, easy access to condoms and this somehow priveleges us....</p><p>Despite the fact that even having a condom can get a twoc arrested on suspicion of solicitation....</p>
