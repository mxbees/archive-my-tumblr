<p>and like&#8230; as someone who once dated in the gay world presenting as an asian guy?</p>

<p>u can fuck the hell off with ur compulsory femininity.</p>

<p>u don&#8217;t even <em>know</em> what this means</p>

<p>to be compulsorily framed as feminine</p>

<p>in a context that fucking despises and hate femininity</p>
