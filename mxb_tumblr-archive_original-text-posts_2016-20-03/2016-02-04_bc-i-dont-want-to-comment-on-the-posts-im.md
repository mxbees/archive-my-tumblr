bc i don't want to comment on the posts i'm seeing.

the most amusing (but not really) thing about the whole 'why isn't there an asian month, etc'

is that there multiple. i know there is a filipino-american month or whatever (october). pretty sure there is a chinese month, etc and so on.

in terms of racial discourse and the ongoing impact of scientific racism

it fascinates me how most of the other races have differentiated into distinct ethnicities.

but for Black americans esp.

there is still just 'Black'.

the fact that a hugely diverse group of people (re: history, language, culture, ethnicity) gets ghettoized to a single month and reduced to a single, monolithic colour

while the rest of us get shit like 'filipino month'

the real question here is:

why isn't there a 'yellow history month' or a 'red history month'?

why are we (non-Black poc) according a level of individuality and humanity apparently impossible for Black ppl to acheive?

(the answer of course is 'anti-Blackness'. except that so many of us still want to pretend like this isn't a distinct thing of its own, even as the ridiculous and anti-Black questions we tend to ask highlight the exact reasons why it is a distinct thing.)
