poll:

i'm current discussing with a friend ways to make my writing a bit more accessible

(since i know ppl can't necessarily read my longer things)

i've been kind of playing around with the idea of making short videos (maybe 2-3 minute videos that are carefully scripted, captioned, and with transcripts)

or getting back into making audio posts. 

not sure if anyone saw my biyuti publishing videos. but i'm really awkward on camera. lol.

but what would ppl prefer:

a. video
b. audio
c. me writing more concise summaries
d. breaking my long essays down into smaller, more tightly focused pieces
e. some other idea that is better
