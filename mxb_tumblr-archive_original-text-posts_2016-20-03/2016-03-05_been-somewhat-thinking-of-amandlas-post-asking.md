been somewhat thinking of Amandla's post asking about how to claim feminism when u don't always feel like a woman...

my main problem: i don't care?

i started to write out an answer but stalled out bc i just lack the motivation to try and analyze this.

its funny before i started living as a womanish person, i did openly identify as a feminist. despite the reality that some would've found this unacceptable. 

then i got into trans stuff and, by and large, realized that feminism -- as a whole -- is too limiting for me.

beyond the reality that #girlslikeus aren't really welcome, it just doesn't have much to offer me. some parts i find interesting. but other parts just tedious and dull.

then again, i also find the trans movement tedious and dull too. indeed: i find most Movements(tm) tedious and dull. 

my problem is that i just want freedom.

i don't care about doctrine or how we get there. i'll support any and all movements that have a decent shot of getting us there. near as i can tell, there currently exists no singular movement which via its ideology would ensure my complete and total feedom. that would allow me to be fully human.

and the way a lot of these movements/communities tend to work is that it isn't very easy to belong to more than one. you can have sub-interests, but most people will unify it under some umbrella or other.

and when i say i'm movement 'agnostic' i really fucking mean it. if it comes to pass that, using my best judgement, i think that the MRA movement is going to get me and everyone else free? i'll throw in my hat there. not that i think this will ever actually happen given that MRA ideology is mutually incompatible with my freedom.

but honestly, given my mental proclivities, what i see happening is that a combination of movements working partially independently but being mutually affirming will get us there. and so i stay with a generally meta-level of analysis because what i'm interested in is not how i fit into any of these specific movements but how we can find a way for each movement to work towards it goals without impeding or hindering that of others.

getting to that point where being a 'feminist' (in the most generic sense) and pursuing those goals only affirms, for example, a disability justice activist. that a person focusing on 'women' doesn't interfere with a person focusing on disability.

hmm... in another way, i guess i'm also thinking that i don't really find all the... attempts to make each movement completely 'inclusive' are all that meaningful. inasmuch as it is true that we are all parts of our identity at all times, its also true that many of us will prioritize one or two aspects (for me atm i'd say its gender and disability. it isn't that my sexuality isn't an important part of my identity, its just that i have other things to focus on right now). 

whether or not feminism is 'inclusive' becomes irrelevant if it, as a whole and for individual feminists, affirms the goals and liberty of disabled people. who may not, for whatever reason, focus on that part of their identity. 

i guess thats the basic thing for me. most of these movements want to become The Movement. that the current discourse within each is how to become increasingly more inclusive such that it basically can encompass everyone. but... as recent history of this approach shows, it doesn't work very well. i'm much more interested in how people can pursue their individual interests that are mutually affirming with people who're focused on other things.
