since i do try to catalogue the ways that disability impacts my life and since i'm still trying to get over internalized ableism wrt chronic illness, today i'm shaking my fist at 'excessive daytime sleepiness' (or somnolence). 

my somnolence is a symptom of sleep apnea. which remains untreated bc i can't afford a cpap machine (and when i do have extra money, i honestly have higher priorities given my poor experience during my cpap trial period -- the thing literally made no difference).

its funny. i don't know why its taken me so long to go "yes, sleep apnea is a chronic illness" given that [there is so much evidence of the harmful effects of chronic sleep deprivation][evidence]. a perennial favourite of mine is:

> Poor Quality of Life: You might, for example, be unable to participate in certain activities that require sustained attention, like going to the movies, seeing your child in a school play, or watching a favorite TV show. [source][webmd]

which is pretty much soooo true of me. pretty much anything that requires sustained attention will make me fall asleep. this morning i was trying to write a blog post. it is, by and large, a fucking mess bc i kept drifting off into [microsleeps][micro]. 

its a pain in the ass bc it doesn't matter what time of the day or even if i've already fallen asleep. if i focus on one particular thing to hard and too long, i will fall asleep. this is why i stopped doing podfic bc audio editing takes too long and too much concentration. 

anyway. its super fun. :D
