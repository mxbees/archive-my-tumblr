you know whats kind of disconcerting?

the fact that hetero porn has started using 'bareback' to describe (some) of their porn.

like... 'barebacking' is kind of meaningless outside of its originating context.

i mean.

het porn usually does not use condoms. het sex in general isn't as intimately tied to the notion of safer sex.

bc... they didn't have to deal with the AIDS crisis in the 80s and major impact this had on gay culture (esp in making the usage of condom both in and out of porn a fairly standard and expected practise)

indeed, part of the whole point of 'barebacking' as a genre is this transgressive element.

which, again, is meaningless in a het context.

(erm. i'm neither defending nor criticizing barebacking as practise here. i do have opinions about it, but i'm keeping them to myself. i'm really just interested in pointing out the cultural and historical context of it. i def. have feelings about the fetishization of barebacking. anyway straight ppl are weird.)
