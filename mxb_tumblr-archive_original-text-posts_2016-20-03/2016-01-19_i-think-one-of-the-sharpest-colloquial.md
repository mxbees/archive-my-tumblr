i think one of the sharpest colloquial observations

(one i sarcastically used myself in my youth)

is

'well, sorry for living'

(spoken in that sarcastic, whiny voice that only teens are truly capable of)

who was to know, that mere years later,

you'd come to realize that everyday

ppl expect this exact apology.

sorry for living.
