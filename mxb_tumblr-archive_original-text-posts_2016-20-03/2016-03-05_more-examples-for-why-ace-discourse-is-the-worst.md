more examples for why ace discourse is the worst and why i refuse to align myself with that community.

like. just n o.

i rebuke thee.

doesn't matter that i'm technically ace. that my bro is technically ace. and that we are having a super awesome ace-style relationship.

i could be the fucking poster child for Healthy Asexuality if i really wanted.

but i hate white aces too much to bother.

sometimes i think about writing about my experiences of accidentally getting into a monogamous ace relationship...

and how we navigated that and whatever.

but meh. i like to keep some parts of my private life private.
