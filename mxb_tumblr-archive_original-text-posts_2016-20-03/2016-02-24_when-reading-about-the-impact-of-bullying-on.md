when reading about the impact of bullying on victims...

i really don't want to see the findings presented side by side with the impacts of bullying on bullies.

what i just read makes some bizarre equivalency between the two. 

while also perpetuating one of the harmful survivor myths: ' Often, especially in middle and high school, those who were bullied at a young age grow up to become bullies themselves.'

often. whats 'often'. i'm remembering [my post about intergenerational abuse](http://syx.pw/1YnMiYw)

it isn't that i don't think that bullies ought to be subjects of research. they should be. how else are we going to figure out how to effectively intervene and get them to stop?

but.... presenting the impacts side by side as if the harm of being a bully and the harm of being bullied are just... interchangeable. 

no thanks.
