i'm looking at this one post about executive dysfunction advice and how a particular person doesn't find most advice useful.

to some extent, i understand where they are coming from. it is true that i look at a lot of advice and i'm like 'this would not work with my brain'

but this also highlights the problems with their criticism:

most generalized advice isn't going to be immediately applicable to you, as an individual.

like. they describe the advice they see and why it wouldn't work for them.

which fine. but... i'm tryng to also understand why they think its some random person on the internet's job to find solutions tailored to their specific manifestation of executive dysfunction.

and they cross domains... they liken a generalized post to concern trolling, wherein people give you well-intended advice that isn't helpful at all. but... a person making a post about stuff they think might work (or that actually works for themselves) isn't concern trolling. 

the advice may or may not work for you.

but the thing is? it's actually useful either way.

i'm looking at this post and the person has detailed various methods and why they don't work for them. except... that this is actually useful information? while, no, they haven't found something that does work, having a good understanding of what doesn't work and *why* will help you find something that *does*.

as far as i can tell, its all just trial and error.

you try one way to manage it and, if it fails, you try to figure out why and how to either adapt that method or look for something else.

rinse. repeat.

but you're unlikely to find a generalized post on the internet that will suggest methods and strategies that just happen to line up exactly with your specific manifestation and personality and ability.
