title: Hundreds of Nepali paraded and protested for their rights in Kathmandu
---
>Hundreds turned up for the colourful rally - dancing in the streets.

>They are demanding same-sex marriage be guaranteed in the new constitution, gay couples' rights to adopt, buy joint property or inherit from one another.

>Nepal recognised a third gender as early as in 2007 when the Supreme Court ordered the government to scrap all laws that discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.

>This year, it issued passports with "other" as the choice for those who do not wish to be identified as male or female.

>But representatives of the LGBT [lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender] community say they have difficulty obtaining these passports.
