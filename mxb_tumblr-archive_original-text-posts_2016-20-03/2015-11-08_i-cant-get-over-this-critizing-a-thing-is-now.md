i can't get over this. critizing a thing is now silencing.

dissent is apparently unallowed in radical twoc tumblr. hahaha.

i'm already not in ur group. what more do you want?

(i think the most deeply amusing thing is being able to trace the contributios i've actually made to the framework of nihilism. like. whether or not these ppl are aware of it, but some of those ideas are mine. or at least ones i popularized.)

hahaha. anyway.
