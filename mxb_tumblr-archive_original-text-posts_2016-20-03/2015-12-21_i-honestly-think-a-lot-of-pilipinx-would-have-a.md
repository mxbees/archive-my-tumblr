i honestly think a lot of pilipinx

would have a much easier time with this whole

'are asian? pacific islander? latinx? malay? wat.'

if they were to really understand that the PH

is one of those liminal spaces in the world

that betray the incoherence of the white supremacist distinctions that have governed our people for hundreds of years.

its a space we share with much of the caribbean/west indes

(is it a suprise given our location in the east indes????)

in all these discussion, i rarely see the actually right answer given.

or even the right questions asked.
