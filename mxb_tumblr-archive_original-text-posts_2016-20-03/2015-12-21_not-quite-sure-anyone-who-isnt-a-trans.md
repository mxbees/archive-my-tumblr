not quite sure anyone who isn't a trans woman/femme can really understand...

what it means for your very existence to be defined as rape.

like. my existence, according to radfems, *is* rape.

every minute of every day that i insist on being alive

that i insist on that i'm real. that my womanhood and femininity are real.

i am raping (cis women)

as far as i know, this ontological claim and state is unique to trans women.

honestly? this is why any and every discussion of trans women + sexuality

results in death threats and rape accusations.

(ugh. even as i right this my stomach is clenching and my hands shaking. how can i communicate the sheer existential horror that this brings me. i feel like its impossible. and don't. for even a second think that the fact that radfems have sent this idea into the world doesn't have real consequences. some white marine just got a lesser sentence for murdering a trans filipina just by claiming that *him paying her for sex* felt like rape to him bc she was a trans woman. the consequences for this are real and global in scope. fuck. ok. i'm done.)
