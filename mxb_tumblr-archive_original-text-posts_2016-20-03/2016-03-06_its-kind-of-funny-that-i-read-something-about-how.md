its kind of funny that  i read something about how many ppl with sleep disorders

don't want to bring them up with their doctors for fear of looking like they are junkies just looking for drugs.

which was basically my impression from talking with the sleep specialist.

when i asked him if there was something other than cpap to help my apnea

he was immediately like 'well, some of the medications can cause DEATH so i won't prescribe them'

and i was like 'um... i meant like, idk, sleeping positions? stuff? not necessarily medication?'

and he was like 'oh. yeah. according to your study, the apnea isn't as bad if u sleep on ur sides'

and i was like 'ok. i'll do that then'

but like now that i've been doing that and it hasnt really made a difference

what if i did want to try medication? apparently not an option. bc why? who knows. meds are bad. better to feel tired and fatigued all the time. and fall asleep everywhere. including in work meetings. no big deal.

my best option might be paying another few thousand dollars to get an adhd dx so i can access the meds that could help improve my quality of life re: sleep disorder.

what fun.
