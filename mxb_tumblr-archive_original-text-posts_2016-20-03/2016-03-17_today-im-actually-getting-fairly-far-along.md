today:

i'm actually getting fairly far along with my ruby script that'll allow me to simultaneously post to wordpress and tumblr.

i had my third panic attack this week. :D

i saw my titty surgeon and got some selfies with me and the various sizes... so i'll have to look at them and see.

i also asked what would happen if i started hormones... and. contrary to what i've seen online, he said that if i get the implants, then start hormones, any natural breast development won't mess it up (which was the biggest worry of course).

i'm also pretty sure that the size we decided on last time was Too Big. i don't want big tits. so i'm going to go smaller. esp bc if i do start hormones they'll get bigger as it is....
