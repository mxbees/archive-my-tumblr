<p>so fucking over ppl telling me that my mind/body is wrong. i hate it bc it took me such a long fucking time to obtain a certain level of peace with it. but no&#8230; always something wrong with it. never good enough. need to change so that i can live and succeeed or whatever.</p>

<p>and, honestly, the weight i&#8217;ve gained in the past two years is just another reason for ppl to be telling me that my body is wrong/bad.</p>
