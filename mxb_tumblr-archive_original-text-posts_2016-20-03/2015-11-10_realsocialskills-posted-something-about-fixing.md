realsocialskills [posted something about fixing what you can and living with the rest][1]. my comment was that this was, more or less, the core of how i approach 'activism' these days. [not too long ago i posted about what i'm doing and why][2].

this partially relates to the anon i blocked who asked me 'wtf have you ever done?'

like. i know these ppl likely don't follow me. but. i honestly couldn't have been clearer in the other post:

> here is what i do: i write and i publish.

this is what i have to offer.

one of the other reasons why i'm a pluralist is precisely bc we all have different interests, abilities, and concerns. i think there are many paths to freedom. my hope is to get as many ppl walking on a path, *any* path.

a part of me believes that if everyone does what they can handle (as in: maintaining self-care, surviving, etc), that the world will indeed change.

like. we do talk about burn-out, ppl getting jaded and exhausted. but. yeah. also important is creating a culture of expectation that participation requires certain things in order for it to be valid and recognized.

it makes me wonder how many ppl give up before they even start.

it is so demoralizing to understand the vastness of how fucked up the world is, take honest stock of what you can do, do those things, only for ppl to constantly tell you that you aren't doing enough. that you need to give more. 

how many ppl see this aspect of activism/advocacy and. just. give. up.
