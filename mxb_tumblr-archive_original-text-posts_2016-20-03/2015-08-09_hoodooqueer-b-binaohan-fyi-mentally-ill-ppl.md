<p>exactly... <br/><br/>not only that. but like. we did have ways of managing and dealing with it (that didn't involve killing ppl like a lot of neo-primitivists seem to think)<br/><br/>i mean. taking even something like PTSD. really? no one was ever traumatised before capitalism? or no one was traumatised enough to get PTSD? <br/><br/>no one ever got depressed? like. REALLY? <br/><br/>how in the fuck does this make sense. capitalism isn't this ahistorical reality that has always been around. </p>
