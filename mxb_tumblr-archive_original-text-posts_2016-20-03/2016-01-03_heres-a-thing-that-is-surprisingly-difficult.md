here's a thing that is surprisingly difficult:

trying to cook for someone else when u have about zero desire to eat

except for a fairly narrow range of things

and u know the other person won't want the one u feel like right now.

even when i was basically non-functional from deression, i had an easier time

like. i have the energy... but there is a general adversion to food.
