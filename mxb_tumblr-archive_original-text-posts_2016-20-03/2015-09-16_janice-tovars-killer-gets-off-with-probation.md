title: Janice Tovar's killer gets off with probation
---
> A man responsible for the 2012 beating of a Dallas transgender woman who died from her injuries is set to receive probation and no jail sentence.

> A spokesperson for the Dallas County District Attorneyâ€™s Office has confirmed to the Observer that Jonathan Stuart Kenney, 29, is expected to plead guilty Tuesday to first-degree felony aggravated assault. Under a plea bargain, Kenney will be sentenced to 10 years probation for the death of his then-partner, Janette Tovar.

It's funny (in the way that it really isn't) since I've been reading trans news... can you guess the race of this man?

I really am seeing a pattern here.
