<p>Anyone who says that they need 'rational' or 'logical' arguments for why they shouldn't oppress people or why they should see marginalized people as human...</p>&#13;
<p>Can have all the fucking seats. All of them. And maybe should go play in traffic.</p>&#13;
<p>Because you are a shitstain. Because you fail at being human.</p>&#13;
<p>Fuck you. Forever. And ever.</p>&#13;
<p>What the fuck is wrong with you?</p>&#13;
<p>Fine.</p>&#13;
<p>Feel free to use this argument whenever you need to be convinced that oppression is wrong and marginalized people are human:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>1. If p then q</p>&#13;
<p>2. p</p>&#13;
<p>Therefore, q.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Just fill in the variables as needed.</p>&#13;
<p>Example:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>If I need logic to be see people as human, then I am an asshole.</p>&#13;
<p>I need logic to see people as human.</p>&#13;
<p>Therefore, I am an asshole.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Easy! </p>
