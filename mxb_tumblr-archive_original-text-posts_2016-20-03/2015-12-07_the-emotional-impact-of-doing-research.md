title: the emotional impact of doing research
---
I started to talk on twitter about why my [recent essay on race][1] is being posted in two parts...

I hit a block. Not a writer's block, mind you, I know what I want to write about and the writing part isn't the problem. The problem is the research. The next thing on my list is [Francis Galton's, "Eugenics, Its Definition, Scope, and Aims"][2][^1]. For those who don't know Galton is the person usually 'credited' with coining the term 'eugenics'. So this is a primary source written by the white man who helped build what would become the eugenics movement.

For obvious reasons, I don't feel emotionally up to reading this at the moment. Doing the research for Part 01 was tough enough (again, because of the primary sources). I think I finished this part at least two months ago? And I just haven't been able to press on.

One of the things that isn't often talked about is how this kind of research impacts marginalized ppl[^2]. As a person oppressed by racism and white supremacy, one who also (like many of us) has general trauma caused by colonialism that spans centuries, reading these things isn't easy.

Especially bc I no longer approach this stuff as an academic. There is no distance between me and the subject. No level of objectivity. Reading the writing of someone who basically built scientific racism, someone whose writing literally, within the span of the five or six pages, transforms me and my people from vibrant, living people into an oppressed class. 

It feels absurd in a painful way that some crusty german in 1795 measured some fucking skulls and \*bam\* there goes the humanity of most of the world[^3]. 

Because this is personal, I have been reading these things with a partial eye towards understanding how pilipinxs fit into it all. So... I'm not sure I can describe how it feels to read this footnote by Blumenbach:

> The Indian from the Philippine Islands, whom I saw alive in London at Alex Dalrymple's, was in appearance exactly this sort of middle man. (270)

There is something I find so utterly chilling about the fact that Blumenbach specifically has to state that he saw this distant ancestor of mine 'alive'. 

I know I'm not the only one to feel this way about this kind of historical ressearch. However, I see so little discussion about how... (re)traumatizing it can be to read and study this type of thing. And, of course, it is one of the white supremacist elements of academia that research necessitates some kind of emotional distance from the subject.

Okay. I don't even know what I'm trying to say anymore. So I'm going to stop writing. I just... I want anyone who does this kind of research and who, like me, suffers some kind of emotional damage because of it to know that you aren't alone. This is difficult work. And we all should do what we can to... engage it safely and sustainably. I just wish I knew what that actually *was* (so far, my main strategy is taking very very long breaks in between research and writing sessions).

[^1]: General trigger warning for this link. I have no idea what it says bc I haven't been able to get myself to read it. So take care.

[^2]: I totally remember reading something about this recently, so if anyone knows of a post or article that discusses this issue, please let me know so I can properly credit it.

[^3]: Obviously Blumenbach was part of a larger historical moment. He didn't single handedly create racism... despite his massive impact on it.
