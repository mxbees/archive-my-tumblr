observation about this asian store owners in Black neighbourhoods:

other non-Black asians realise this wouldn't be a problem if we

1. participated and contributed to the community
2. didn't treat Black ppl like criminals

i mean. its just that easy.

show some care, love, and respect for the community ur in?

and suddenly, ppl have less of a problem. go figure.
