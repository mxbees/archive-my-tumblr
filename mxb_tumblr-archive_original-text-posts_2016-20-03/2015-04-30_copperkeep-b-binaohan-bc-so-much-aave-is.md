<p>how often have i said exactly this. y’all don’t even know the words are ours because we get erased as soon as they come out of our mouth. i don’t even call half of you on it bc its so second-nature to you and i do not have the time</p></blockquote>

*nods*

this is why i've started to try and call ppl out on it, since a friend asked and this kind of this is so commonplace that i can imagine it being fucking _exhausting_ to have to call out. 

also why nonBlack 'allies' (like me) need to work extra hard not to engage in this kind (but really all kinds) of antiBlack appropriation.
