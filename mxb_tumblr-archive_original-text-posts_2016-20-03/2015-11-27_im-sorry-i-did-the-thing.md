title: iâ€™m sorry. i did the thing.
---
i did the thing i said i wasn't going to do anymore. it turns out that i just like [having my own space][1]. 

i'm not changing URLs though for the tumblr. i'll keep using my other one for my off tumblr blog. most of what i post there will be crossposted here.

what i actually plan on doing is [more stuff like this][2], where instead of posting a giant wall of text on tumblr (where ppl see really adverse to it -- this is just an observation, no criticism implied). i'll post links to my posts that end up more than 500 words, with short, (hopefully) clear summaries of the content.

ppl can click through to read if they want the entire thing or just get the main points.

i'm planning on writing a lot more summaries and outlines for previous essays and long posts, so that people can at least get the general idea of what i've been writing about if they don't have the spoons to read a 6000 word essay on pluralism (which i really do understand -- again not a criticism).

i also had fun writing my own static blog generator. that blog? i built the *entire* thing. Like. the software that creates it? i made it. i'm pretty happy with it, overall. :D
