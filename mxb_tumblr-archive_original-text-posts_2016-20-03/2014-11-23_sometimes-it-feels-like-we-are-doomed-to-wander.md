<p>sometimes&#8230;</p>

<p>it feels like we are doomed to wander around in the same circle over and over again</p>

<p>with nothing substantive changing.</p>

<p>originally i hadn&#8217;t wanted to say anything about the callouts of anti-Blackness i&#8217;ve seen re: darkmatterrage</p>

<p>bc ppl should really REALLY listen to the Black ppl who&#8217;ve done the calling out.</p>

<p>and, tbh, i feel like</p>

<p>why haven&#8217;t u been in a position to hear these criticisms before?</p>

<p>same with the ppl asking &#8216;what do we do?&#8217;</p>

<p>why aren&#8217;t you already listening to Black ppl?</p>

<p>Black ppl have been telling us for a long time what they want from non-Black ppl.</p>

<p>i mean. i suppose i could&#8217;ve just stuck with personal experience and the ways that they&#8217;ve repackaged some of my ideas.</p>

<p>but i&#8217;d rather ppl pay attention to the anti-Blackness</p>
