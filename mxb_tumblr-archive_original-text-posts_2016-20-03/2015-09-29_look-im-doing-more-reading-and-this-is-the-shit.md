look. i'm doing more reading and this is the shit i'm reading:

> Historians such as Quinn, Jones, Canny and Muldoon argue effectively that racism amont Europeans is not limited to the relations with non-Europeans, but that it can exist in the most extreme form between one European nation, such as England, and another, such as Ireland.[^1]

the _most_ extreme form of european racism is between white ppl?

not, say, idk, the race of ppl they decided were property?

like. this is scholarship today?
