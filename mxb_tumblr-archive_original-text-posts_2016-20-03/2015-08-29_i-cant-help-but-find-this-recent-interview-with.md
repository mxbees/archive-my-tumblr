I can't help but find [this recent interview, with a white academic, in the NYT fascinating][1]. The academic is Susan Stryker, who is a white trans woman. And apparently Teh Authority on trans history.

She's asked "Do we know conclusively who threw the first brick or punch that night?"

And her answer?

>We know nothing conclusively. Besides, it’s wrongheaded to be overly concerned with pinning one clear-cut act on one identifiable person, in a misguided attempt to say that so-and-so rather than so-and-so “started” Stonewall, and that therefore history teaches us that X rather than Y is true. A heterogeneous street crowd started the resistance at Stonewall, not a particular person.

She calls the debate over this history a 'proxy battle for more entrenched structural conflicts':

>Arguing about whether drag queens, transwomen, butches, or gender-nonconforming street kids were present at Stonewall, or whether they (and they alone) were responsible for escalating the resistance to police violence, serves mostly as an arena in which some non-transgender gays and lesbians can express antipathy towards trans people and reject political alliance with them as part of an imagined LGBT community. Likewise, trans people, particularly trans people of color, engage in the same debates about history to express a justifiable outrage over the continued marginalization of, and prejudice toward, trans people by many homonormative cisgender gays and lesbians

Basically, what we are getting here is that Stonewall is a contested site from two sides trying advance certain political agendas. With cis gays and cis lesbians, they argue over history as a way to disavow trans ppl being a part of teh ~community~, whereas trans ppl (~esp~ tpoc) argue over it because we are marginalized by cis gays and cis lesbians.

This is super interesting to me for the ways that it completely elides the fact that the hijacking of Stonewall from twoc (and thus the entire movement it started) was actually an intentional and purposeful strategy. Something that started within _years_ of the riot. At a point where it was current enough and survivors findable enough that it was probably fairly easy to get a decent idea of who was there and what happened. 

This is a contested site between groups in the community not because it is a proxy for entrenched inter-community issues but because it is the actual source and beginning of some of these entrenched divisions. The erasure of twoc from the history of Stonewall was and is political and intentional.

Later on she says "Sylvia Rivera and Marsha Johnson, two indisputably important trans women of color who founded Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) and claimed to have taken part in the riots."

Oh. I see.

So we can't 'really' ~know~ what happened that night and who did what because... What? Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson are unreliable narrators? We can't trust their words and accounts of what happened? Its almost like the testimony and experiences of twoc count for less than homonationalist white mythology.

Anyway, fuck white trans women.
