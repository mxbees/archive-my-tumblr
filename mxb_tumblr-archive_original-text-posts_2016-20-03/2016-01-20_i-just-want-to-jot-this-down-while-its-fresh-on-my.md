i just want to jot this down while its fresh on my mind...

a friend recently questioned one of my recent posts, saying that perhaps it advocates for a politics of despair. and might, at the end of it all, demotivate people from even trying to live ethically.

i just realized that part of the problem with how some ppl (not necessarily my friend, mind you) interpret my writing comes from... not remembering that i'm primarily a virtue ethicist.

consequentialism has become so deeply embedded within our notions of ethical behaviour that most ppl tend to use this as the default context for interpreting ethical arguments/claims.

however. while i do think that some level of consequentalism is important, as a virtue ethicist i don't think that the main purpose for ethical behaviour is 'reducing harm to others' or, stated positively, 'maximizing the good for the greatest number of people' (which is kind of classic utilitarianism). in any case, consequentalism examines behaviour via a lens of looking at the consequances of your actions, such that the consequences matter more than intent or adherence to rules.

this is not how i conceive of 'living ethically'.

for me. it is more the case that, you know in that xmas song? i can't remember which one, but there's a lyric that goes 'be good for goodness' sake'. *thats* virtue ethics in a really general way.

in a really small, reductive way, the point imo is in trying to be good (however construed). now. as above, consequentalism does factor in for me but not to the same extent as it does for many people i know. trying really hard to be good, yet significantly harming many people... fails to strike me as truly ethical behaviour. but i guess i'm sort of saying that, to some extent, i really do think that intentions play an important role in contextualising ppl's actions. and to a greater degree than a lot of ppl i know. they aren't the sole determinant, but they do matter to me.
