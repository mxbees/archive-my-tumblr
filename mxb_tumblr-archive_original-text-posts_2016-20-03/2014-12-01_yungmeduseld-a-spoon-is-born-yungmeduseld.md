<p>that part about how mental illness is a context and not a condition really resonated</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can really only speak for myself but I think that among mentally ill people, there’s this stark difference between people who sort of separate their identity and their mental illness very sharply as opposed to people like me where it’s just kind of seamlessly integrated into who I am. Because if we’re defined by our experiences and our responses to circumstances, then mental illness as well as neurodivergence and autism were a large part of my formative/identity-shaping experiences.</p>
<p>It’s…me decolonizing some of my pathology. And like, unraveling medical terminology is part of that; writing that way helps. A decade ago, all the tools I had for coping with “parts” of myself: cognitive-behavioral therapy, medication, each was for treating one of <em>eight</em> diagnoses I’ve received in my lifetime. And I didn’t have the language to describe it-I was using visual art to process it, but I couldn’t explain it. So a lot of it is about putting all these medically labeled parts back together into a human being. Becoming verbal in that way.</p>
<p>This is on my mind a lot because of the work I’m doing for Lydia Brown’s Autistic PoC anthology; like, the process of decolonizing your identity as a disabled person, and thinking about overlapping identities less as parts in a machine and more like a recipe. And colonized pathology is binary: one or the other; better or worse; “you” and “your illness”. About autism and creating a decolonized discourse for that.</p>
<p>There is go much going on with whiteness and disability discourse-like, these kind of wrongheaded, nearly post-apocalyptic scenarios that white disabled people imagine when they think about concepts like “after Capitalism is ended” or “once oppression is over, what then?” Like, people who say verbatim, “I want to be against capitalism, but I need my medication/technology to survive, and I feel guilty!” Needlessly binary logic again: as if capitalism and technology are the same thing, leading to the baby-and-bathwarer scenario above. To the point where I have seen poc activists ask themselves what their identities <em>mean</em> without oppression. Autistic activists who have asked me, “but what does an ‘autistic community’ look like, if we achieve these goals?”</p>
<p>And the thing is, if the answers to these questions are not obvious to you, then I am afraid. For you? Of you? Both? How is oppression so seemingly natural to you, that imagining yourself free of it is nearly impossible? That’s what frightens me-the limited imaginations of people who obviously care a great deal. To me, asking about the meaning of identity in the absence of oppression is like asking a person with a broken leg: “But WHO would you BE without your broken leg??”</p>
<p>A decolonized discourse for disability necessitates history as collective memory-because that leg was not always broken; there is an AFTER because there was a BEFORE. My mental illness makes me terrified of changelessness, my neurotype makes me phobic of change. There is no room for my reality in a binary and colonized disability discourse because I’m at odds with myself in a way that is both created by and utterly defies white pathology. Decolonizing is often spoken of as a process of removal; for me, it has always felt more like re-assembling the parts of myself back into the person I am.</p>
<p>actually I’m very interested in what <a class="tumblelog" href="http://tmblr.co/mQ1cxfcq2fduTOMS6HL6Uvw">b-binaohan</a> thinks, too….</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These “who would you be without oppression shaping you” questions are so odd to me. They make my brain process stall. To me, it’s this counter intuitive question. Does it matter? Why? Why not “Who would I want to be without oppression?” Or why not “<br /><br />Why is oppression central to community? It really doesn’t have to be, we are so much more than that.<br /><br />In a way, you could say the same thing with mental illness applies to communities: <strong>they’re the context in which we exist.</strong></p>

<p>Ahhh, you’re fucking brilliant. YES.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ah, I&#8217;m just rambling, ha, but thanks! :D I also wanna know what Rook thinks about this.</p></blockquote>

i think the thing that is tickling my brain the most with this post

(and i agree with a bunch of stuff already said)

is, yes, focusing on the 'disability as context' and what this really means.......

bc. one of the biggest problems i have with white disability discourse is the (as always) super heavy focus on the individual. like there is no real room for a community-level or collective analysis of disability or self. 

like. one thing that is comming to mind is that quotation that was going around about the white psychologist or whatever that were sent to Rwanda to help people deal with the trauma, but they were largely inneffective bc all of the solutions/therapies were centred solely on individuals and didn't involve the community. 

in much the same what that my mental disabilities/neurotype are the context in which my individual thinking happens, so too is my community the context in which i'm coherent/intelligible. like.......

i know a lot of how i think about this sort of stuff is not only deeply influenced by growing up in a really close/tight knit extended family of Filipin@s but also by my studies into Chinese philosophy and... u know the way that they definitely do not locate the 'self' as a discrete/non-overlapping unit from the rest of the community, rather part of how you derive your sense of self is via the unique nexus of social relationships you have to other people

(which isn't even that alien to white discourse, but it is rarely ever considered noteworthy the way that some people will identify themselves as a 'father' or a 'mother' which is an identity that necessarily involves other people and cannot exist in isolation)

and i think what gets me about how ppl don't seem to realize that really depathologizing neurodivergence necessarily will mean community-wide change...

bc i'm suddenly struck, as well, about how the 'mental illness as context' is also not really a strange notion for neuro-typical people. like this is something we fundamentally already understand

like. i'm now thinking of all the different (non-pathologized) learning styles "visual, kenetic, audio, etc" and folk psychology stuff like 'introverts, extroverts' or other personality stuff like the meyers-briggs where i literally see people put 'intj' or whatever on the 'about me' descriptions on their blogs.

so people already get that brains are built differently and that the ways that they are built structure how we interface with and conceptualize the world. like we literally use this discourse to talk about ourselves all the time. 

and for me the liberatory power of decolonizing mental illness has been understanding that, in this respect, my brain is no different _and_ that is okay. 

bc like.... the way that disability is socially constructed is that people will understand if you say "i don't want to go out tonight bc i'm an introvert" but not as readily accept "i don't want to go out tonight bc i have a social phobia".

and seen from this view, this is why the post-apocalyptic scenarios don't make any sense. bc if we can already go around and say "i'm a visual learner!" or "i'm an intj!" and have these be comprehensible and meaningful statements, i don't see why decolonizing disability should make "i'm autistic" suddenly incomprehensible and meaningless. moreover... it also means that accommodating autism would be just as easy as accommodating visual learners... and just as common. like.

if u read about pedagogical theories and how to give talks/lectures 'correctly' so many of them will say "make sure to teach to different learning styles" but of course this is restricted to 'audio, visual, kinetic'. 

(and now my brain has interrupted that train of thought to make the connection to the community/collective aspect of this all... since what i'm also highlighting here is that decolonzing/depathologizing disability will necessarily have this community-level aspect to it. it is about freeing individuals *and* transforming communities.)

er... and i think my brain is done.

idk if this is what anyone was expecting but this is what spilled forth. lol.
