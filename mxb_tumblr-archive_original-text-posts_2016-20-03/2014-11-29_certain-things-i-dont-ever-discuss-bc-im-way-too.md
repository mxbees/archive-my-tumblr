<p>certain things i don&#8217;t ever discuss bc i&#8217;m way too fucking ignorant on the subject to even want to make even the smallest comment</p>

<p>things like antisemitism?</p>

<p>i know pretty much nothing beyond that Jewish people are oppressed.</p>

<p>that is the full extent of my knowledge tbh</p>
