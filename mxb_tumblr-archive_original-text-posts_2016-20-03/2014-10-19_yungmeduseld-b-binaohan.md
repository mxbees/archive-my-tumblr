<p>i remember reading a book that was interviews + essays by ppl w/ disabilities who didnt have that cartesian duality and it was super interesting and really helpful to me.</p>

<p>it is suddenly reminding me why i have so many issues with trans humanism or cyborg theories and stuff…</p>
<p>i don’t actually subscribe to a world view where my body is distinct from my mind. i don’t think it is possible to upload our minds to the internet or whatever. i don’t think there is a coherent way to say that our minds can exist independently of our bodies and while i understand why some people find enormous potential in this …</p>
<p>but i’m fucking <em>tired</em> of being told that my body is wrong</p>
<p>that i have to overcome it to exist as a free person.</p>
<p>it my body/mind. and the fact that the world is a hostile place for me, doesn’t make it wrong…</p>

<p>But seriously, you put something into words a thing that has been in the back of my subconscious. Like…. I <em>like and trust my body (mostly, re: trust, despite the pain)</em> but like also… I acknowledge that if you tried to separate my mind and spirit from this body, I would become someone else. It’s a whole new incarnation.</p></blockquote>

<p>and this is totally the same logic that feeds into the 'woman trapped in a mans' body narrative in white trans theory.<br/><br/>and this is, i think, the justification that a lot of parents feel when they murder their disabled children... 'freeing' the mind trapped in that terrifying body<br/><br/>and i think about all the ways i've been taught to hate my body<br/><br/>eyes too dark, skin not white enough, eyes too small, not feminine enough, and so on and on on on on<br/><br/>and i'm like...<br/><br/>i may not have been able to get to a place where i love my body/self... but i'm geting to a place where i don't hate it.<br/><br/>it's mine. and fuck anyone who wants to tell me it exists in the wrong way.<br/><br/>it is _me_</p>
