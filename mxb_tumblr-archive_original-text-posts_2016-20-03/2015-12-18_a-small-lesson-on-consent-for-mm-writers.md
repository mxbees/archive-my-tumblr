title: a small lesson on consent for mm writers
---
Insofar as I can deal with rape as a part of fiction (I have no desire to get into a discussion of artistic merits or whatever), the thing I can't deal with is when characters are raped _but the narrative does not frame it this way_.

What I mean by this, is that the sexual encounter has a violation of consent, but the writer (and thus the characters) apparently fail to understand that what just happened was non-consensual sex (ie, rape). I'm also not talking about the whole 'dub-con' thing, since at least the people who are writing it (and thus put labels on it to warn ppl) understand that there is _something_ going on in these situations.

(tw: for descriptions of rape in the rest of this post)

Example 1: people who are sleeping cannot consent to sex. If I had a nickel for everytime I've heard the "I woke him up with a blowjob" situation in an mm book, I'd probably be able to buy tits without assistance.

This? Is rape. Again: Sleeping (unconsious) people cannot consent to sex.

Example 2: Barebacking someone after you've agreed to have sex with a condom is also rape. 

(And I don't want to hear the excuses "they were super passionate and caught up in the moment!". anal sex generally requires _some_ level of preparation. If your characters are taking the time to stretch and lube? They clearly are being intentional enough that 'forgetting' a condom in the heat of passion is pretty unbelievable.)

Example 3: The whole 'a six pack of beer is all that separates a straight man from a gay one'. If one of your characters is drunk and the other not so much? A lot of books with this situation will have the drunk one persistently coming on to the not drunk one. Still.... not consensual, as it happens. A decent (but not foolproof) guideline is that if a person is inebriated enough that they aren't allowed to legally drive? Their judgement is impaired enough not to be able to consent.[^1] And I hope it is... obvious that if one character *intentionally* gets another inebriated for the purpose of sex? Um... this is what we call 'date rape'.

Example 4: BDSM. Please note that blanket consent does not exist. A lot of mm writers enjoy infusing their sexual scenes with implicit or explicit sub/dom play. Look. Its important that *all* sex is negotiated. A lot of mm writers have this heteronormative idea in their head that top=dom and bottom=sub. Not the case. Consenting to bottom is not also consent to sub.

Please do note what I'm communicating here: if you present non-consensual sex as unproblematic/consensual, you are contributing to rape culture. I'm not talking about cases in fiction where the character understands their experience as rape. I'm talking about the normalization of rape as a 'sexy' thing with no apparent awareness that what just happened was, indeed, rape.

[^1]: With this one, there is some... wiggle room? If both are drunk. No wiggle room, however, if one partner's judgement is significantly impaired and the other's is not.
