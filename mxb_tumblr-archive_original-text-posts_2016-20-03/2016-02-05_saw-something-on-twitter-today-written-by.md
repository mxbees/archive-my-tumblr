saw something on twitter today...

written by someone i used to respect a great deal.

she referenced one the ideas i recently reintroduced into the Discourse

(and is now becoming a commonly used term)

all i can think is... at one point, you used to be one of the most insightful and nuanced thinkers i knew

and then...

and then. what?

i still don't understand how/why u did what you did.

and now i don't get how u managed to miss the entire point of the concept u were critiquing...

only for your critique to make the actual point of the concept.
