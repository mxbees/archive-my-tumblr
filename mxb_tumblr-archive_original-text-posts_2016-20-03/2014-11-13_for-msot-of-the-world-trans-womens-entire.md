<p>for msot of the world</p>

<p>trans women&#8217;s entire existence revolves around our shrodinger&#8217;s penis</p>

<p>so many ppl will be amazed and agog</p>

<p>at the fact that some trans women will do away with teh almighty penis</p>

<p>this possible absence of the magical,mighty penis is a great source of despaire, fear, and hatred for a subset of the ppl who hate trans women</p>

<p>on the other hand&#8230; are all the people who worry endlessly and obsess about the fact that a trans woman might actually</p>

<p><em>have</em></p>

<p>teh almighty penis</p>

<p>this also causes feelings of fear, disgust, and extreme hatred</p>

<p>interestingly&#8230; the two groups don&#8217;t really overlap all that much, but they sort of do too.</p>

<p>the whole notion of the trap</p>

<p>is the dire fear of the unknown</p>

<p>is there or isn&#8217;t there a penis????</p>

<p>how can ppl live with this kind of ambiguity????</p>

<p>worse is the implications&#8230;</p>

<p>if we do accept that trans women are, indeed, women</p>

<p>than&#8230;.</p>

<p>every woman potentially could have the penis</p>

<p>life looses all meaning</p>

<p>it is the end of the world</p>

<p>no one will be able to sleep at night anymore</p>

<p>(except for us&#8230; since our fearsome power is knowledge. we are the few. the chosen. we actually know what is what. we can sleep peacefully at night&#8230;)</p>
