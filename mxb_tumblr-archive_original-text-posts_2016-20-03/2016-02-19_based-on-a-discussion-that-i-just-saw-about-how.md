based on a discussion that i just saw about how anxiety has a negative impact on some ppl's enjoyment of video games...

and thinking about what i was saying the other day about how if i'm into a book, i can easily get too anxious about not knowing what is going to happen.

like. i listen to mm romance. r o m a n c e. and the suspense can get me so anxious that i'll have to take a break from a book for *months* before i'm ready to start listening again.

i'm in the middle of at least 50 books rn bc of this.

fifty. books.

like of all the things that anxiety has influenced and turned sour

this was one of the least expected and one of the most irritating.

i listen to these books to *relax*

and my anxiety has me so worried about what is going to happen that i sometimes loose sleep over it.
