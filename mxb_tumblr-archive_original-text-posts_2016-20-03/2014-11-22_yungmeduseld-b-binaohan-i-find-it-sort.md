<blockquote><p>I find it… </p>

<p>Sort disingenuous for non Black ppl to ask,  at this point </p>

<p>"what can we do about dmr and antiBlackness" </p>

<p><br />
??? </p>

<p>as if this is a real question. </p>

<p>first. we as non Black ppl created this situation. we are the antiBlack context that allowed two nonBlack poc to raise to such prominence in the community </p>

<p>to the extent that they are being asked to stand as authorities over things that they can never and should never be allowed to claim authority over. </p>

<p>we did this. we are the context that allows this to happen. </p>

<p>what can we do? </p>

<p>the question isn’t for us to answer. </p>

<p>Black ppl are already telling us what they need.</p></blockquote>

<p>TBH I feel like unless y&#8217;all are meeting with them in these places and calling them to be accountable, y&#8217;all can fuck off. Like, how do you have meetings about anti/Blackness and have noooo Black people in the room. Like. Bitch whet. I bet they use AAVE.</p></blockquote>

here is a thing that we (non-Black ppl) can do.
