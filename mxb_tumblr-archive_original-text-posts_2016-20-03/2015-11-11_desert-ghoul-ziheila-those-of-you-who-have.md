<p>Those of you who have a sleep disorder, especially narcolepsy, how do you force yourself to wake up? I just slept a little over 9 hours and I can barely keep my eyes open even though I moved myself away from my bed and into sunlight.</p>

i have sleep apnea... but my score on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test was bad enough that the amount of daytime sleepiness i experience is narcolepsy-like (so i'm told anyway). i also can't afford a cpap machine so its untreated and yeah. somnolence is kind of a big thing for me.

ugh. i wish i had a good answer for this.

bc honestly? all i do is coffee in the morning. and it... doesn't really do the best job? mostly bc i'm unwilling to drink the amount that it would probably take to actually keep me awake and alert.

example: this morning, my sleepiness was such that i fell asleep at my desk while drinking coffee. and then i fell asleep at my desk again. and like... uncontrollably. just. can't keep myself awake (which is why i got tested for narcolepsy in the first place). 

with how frequently i feel tired/fatigued from my sleep disorder, i think the only other way i manage it is, in part, relying on my autistic need to adhere to my schedule (so my compulsion to get up at a certain time so that the rest of my day follows my regular schedule is more powerful than how sleepy i am). this might not be useful for you. 

the other thing is taking planned naps (which i stopped doing for a while). this may not be useful for you either, since if i nap, i usually won't randomly fall asleep. not sure if this would work for narcolepys.

um... other things i've done is force myself into the shower right away. usually by the time i'm finished i'm at least alert enough to make coffee or something. but. i can't always/often do this. sometimes i need to drink a cup of coffee *before* i shower so that i have enough energy to do that. 

crap. idk. none of this is probably useful. i'm sorry. i guess i just don't really manage it very well.
