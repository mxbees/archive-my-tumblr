and tbh. i wouldn't have a problem with these apologists if they'd just own it.

like. stop being disingenuous and just fucking say that u like it being inaccessible.

i can at least admit that my writing isn't intended for everyone.

that i don't try to make it accessible for everyone and ppl shouldn't ask me bc i don't care if 'everyone' can read it or not.

but ur not going to ever see me try to come up with some Moral Imperative for why this is 'good'. 

it just is. and its the way its going to say.
