seeing some ace positivity thing and... the last point is 'no one is broken'

which contradicts their other point that u know ur identity better than anyone else.

u know what i know about myself? that i'm broken.

i don't think asexuality has anything to do with it. 

but i'm broken nonetheless.

like its great and all to try and tell ppl they aren't broken.

but i also want a world where those of us who *are* broken are

affirmed, loved, supported, etc.
