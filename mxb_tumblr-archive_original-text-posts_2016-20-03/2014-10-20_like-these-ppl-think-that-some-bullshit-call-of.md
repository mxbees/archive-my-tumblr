<p>like these ppl think that some bullshit call of &#8216;ableism&#8217;</p>

<p>gives them a right to decide which victim/survivor narratives are valid or not?</p>

<p>SO HAPPPY</p>

<p>i have ppl who aren&#8217;t me</p>

<p>and who didn&#8217;t have to grow up with my dad</p>

<p>ready to fucking decide</p>

<p>that no, in actual fact, my dad didn&#8217;t use mood swings as a method of abuse</p>

<p>i guess this will cure my generalized anxiety</p>

<p>and hyper vigilence</p>

<p>borne out of a childhood living in an environment of quiet terror</p>

<p>bc i never knew what kind of mood my dad might be in next.</p>
