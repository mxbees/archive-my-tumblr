<p>Every trans woman I know that watched Sailor Moon’s favorite Senshi is Sailor Mars or Neptune.</p>

<p>sailor mercury was always my favourite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>wow you’re literally one of the few people I know that likes Mercury period o_o</p>
</blockquote>
<p>wait. why do ppl hate mercury so much?!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She’s really popular in Japan but everyone else doesn’t seem to really fuck with her lmao. I even remember when I was younger I remember there being more anti-Mercury sites out of everybody. I think it’s because she’s quieter than the other Senshi and her powers are more defensive than all of the other Senshi and so she’s seen as being “useless”. </p>
