<p>Black ppl&#8217;s intellectual work isn&#8217;t common property, FYI</p>

<p>so, yeah, if a Black person (and they aren&#8217;t monoliths)</p>

<p>decides that there is <em>this</em> line demarcating between who is or isn&#8217;t a poc</p>

<p>then that&#8217;s that.</p>

<p>srsly.</p>

<p>don&#8217;t come into my inbox talking about how &#8216;poc appropriate&#8217; ur culture</p>

<p>when u are literally trying to colonize Black ppl&#8217;s intellectual work and history</p>
