>Until recently, she'd been changing for gym class in the girl's bathroom. She says concerns about her safety and threats from other girls led her to drop gym class and quit changing in the girls locker room.

>Close to 200 students walked out of class Monday morning, some voicing support for Perry, others expressing their displeasure.
