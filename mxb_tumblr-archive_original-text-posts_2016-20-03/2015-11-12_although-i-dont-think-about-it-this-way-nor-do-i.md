although i don't think about it this way nor do i talk about it much.

maybe it might be useful for some to hear about how i plan on 'transitioning' as a nonbinary dmab person? or whatever?

bc. yeah. i can only think of afab articles/resources or whatever that address enby 'transitioning'. 

(and it always seems the same: top surgery, T, bowties, and fedoras or whatever the fuck)
