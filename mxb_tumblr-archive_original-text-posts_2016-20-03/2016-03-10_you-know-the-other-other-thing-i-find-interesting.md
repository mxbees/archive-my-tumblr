you know the other other thing i find interesting about the east asia vs the rest of us thing?

how the east asian countries have a massively different experience with colonialism than the rest of asia. 

comparatively, china, japan, and korea were basically untouched

like... this difference in our histories? makes a huge difference. and one that isn't frequently acknowledged.
