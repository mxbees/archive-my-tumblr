i'll also admit that i pretty much stop listening whenever i see any variation of 'libfems' or whatever.

or, for that matter, an invocation of 'radical' as a way to locate the person's politics.

i. just. don't. care.

i don't think i've seen any permutation of 'radical' that doesn't depend on ideological purity. i want no part of this.

i'll admit that my commitment to pluralism likely means that i'm more closely aligned to liberal ideology than i'm comfortable with, but i can live with that. esp. since i don't actually subscribe to these political distinctions.

its weird. i've been super vocal -- reapeatedly -- about my distaste for radical subculture. i'm not sure why ppl think that my distaste for the culture doesn't transfer to its advocates.

again. if you've been around long enough absolutely *none* of this should be a surprise.
