i have a feeling about how my life will turn out.

and its... a little depressing. but i guess there isn't anything i can do about it.

the things you need to do to become a Person

aren't things i'm willing to do.

many ppl will be happy to ignore me. to dismiss me.

but then a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend

will echo something i've written. some idea that i've articulate and explicated.

and the very same ppl will be happy to circulate the fruits of my labour.

while i remain poor, alienated, and largely alone
