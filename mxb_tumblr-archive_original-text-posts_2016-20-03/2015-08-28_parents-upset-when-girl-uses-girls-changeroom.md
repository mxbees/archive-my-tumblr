title: Parents upset when girl uses girls changeroom
---
Lila Perry is a high school senior who decided she didn't want to be unconsensually third-sexed, so she used the gender appropriate facilities.

However, because of her transmisogynist classmates and their equally transmisogynist parents, a controversy has broken out at the school. Bigoted parents say that a cis girl's right to privacy matters more than Ms. Perry's dignity.
