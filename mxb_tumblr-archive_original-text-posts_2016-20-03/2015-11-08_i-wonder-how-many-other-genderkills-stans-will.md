i wonder how many other genderkills stans will come out of the woodwork claiming other outrageous things.

look. i barely know anything about her. i literally only became aware of her existence via callouts from Black ppl on her appropriation of aave.

and i also remember that she doubled down on it and refused to apologize. this is literally the only direct knowledge i have of her. i didn't even know she was one of the main ppl behind gender nihilism. 

does her unapologetic anti-Blackness bias me against her? yes. but i've disagreed with gender nihilism (and its protoform in teh community, gender abolition) from the first time i saw it articulated by some ppl like two or three years ago. sure. it has become a more fleshed out and developed theory.

that thing about abuse... wat. no. that group of ppl never abused me. i never gave them the chance. i saw 'gender abolition', i saw clear signs of a culture of ideological purity, and i immediately unfollowed pretty much anyone associated with the theory or that group.

which is also how i've managed to maintain near perfect ignorance of the theory. bc its fucking insular and elitist. but as genderkills adamantely has stated, this is a feature not a bug.

its hilarious that ppl think me thinking that they (and this theory) are irrelevant bc of the purposeful inaccessibility of their group and discourse is saying that they can't do this. they can.

just as i can critique the ideas. c'est la vie.
