<p>i&#8217;m so fucking mad about that logo&#8230;</p>

<p>and the creator doesn&#8217;t really have any info about them on their blog</p>

<p>TDoR isn&#8217;t ~trans awareness~ day. gtfo.</p>

<p>and even though the creator of TDoR is a shitty appropriative white trans woman</p>

<p>i&#8217;m fucking clinging to it anyway</p>

<p>and no one is going to pry that day</p>

<p>and what it represents</p>

<p>out of my hands.</p>

<p>one day a year for ~teh trans community~</p>

<p>to remember the twoc who died so that</p>

<p>a bunch white assholes can co-opt our oppression</p>

<p>while erasing and ignoring us the other 364 days of the year.</p>
