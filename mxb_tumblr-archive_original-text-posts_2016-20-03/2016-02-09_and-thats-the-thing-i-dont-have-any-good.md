and that's the thing.

i don't have any good, helpful advice. not in the way that most ppl want it.

i have advice for how to survive when ur disabled and don't know it.

i can tell u how to slowly, but systematically destroy your mental health... but survive nonetheless. 

how to make decisions that have short-term benefits but that you'll regret in the future.

ask me how.
