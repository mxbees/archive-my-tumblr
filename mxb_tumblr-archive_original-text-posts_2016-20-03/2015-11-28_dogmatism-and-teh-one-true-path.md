title: dogmatism and teh one true path
---
Today for the nth time I'm reminded why I don't trust *anyone* who claims that they've found the One True Path(tm) to liberation.

It isn't even always the case that I think that they are necessarily wrong, I just cannot be convinced that there is one and only one way to freedom. And that they have found the One True Path(tm). And that if I want to be free, the only possible way is to do as they say and follow their lead.

As a person raised catholic and who also converted to seventh day adventism, I've had more than enough of that sort of thing. I don't want anymore.

In any case, here are some of the reasons why I can't trust True Believers(tm):

- Faith in the One True Path(tm) leads to dogmatism.
- Dogmatism leads to notions of ideological purity and the belief that the 'cause' is more important than any given individual.
- True Believers(tm) absolutely do insist that you must martyr yourself for the 'cause', otherwise you are will never be a True Believer(tm).
- Because they are True Believers(tm) they inevitably think that people must be converted to their way of thinking.
- True Believers(tm) don't really tolerate dissent or disagreement very well (or, well, actually human agency tbh).
- The combination of the One True Path(tm) and dogmatism tends to lead to insular communities/groups, where outgroup individuals are viewed with varying degress of pity, disgust, loathing, scorn, etc.

Note: What I'm describing here might sound like religion, but I'm really not talking about that. I'm talking about stuff like the New Atheist Movement. Or even White Feminism. Or Marxism. Socialism. Etc and so on.

I invite and encourage all True Believers(tm) to forever leave me alone. I will never, ever be one of you. Never again.
