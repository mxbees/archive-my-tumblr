like. i cis ppl and their shitty discourse has totally had a negative impact on teh community

but to pretend like the whole 'sex isn't gender' thing wasn't (and still isn't) a central organizing principle of white trans\*nationalist discourse?

perhaps cis ppl did invent the idea, but white trans ppl are the ones who've deeply embeded it within teh Discourse.
