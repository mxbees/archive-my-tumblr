i also wonder if ppl know that it isn't actually very hard

to get information about any given tumblr user's likes.

i know how.

if someone were to grab mine, i'm sure ppl would have a ton of fun

picking apart all the ways i'm an impure heathen for some of the stuff i look at.

despite knowing that yes there are Real Problems with some of my media consumption habits.

(and before anyone starts speculating, i like looking at male models. so...

there are a lot of thin, conventionally, attractive, white men in my likes.

this has been one of my special interests for almost ten years. and yeah

i have been trying to look at more models of colour, but... the industry being what it is

there aren't nearly as many and tumblrs with them are harder to find.

so. have fun raking me over the coals.)
