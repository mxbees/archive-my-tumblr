look. i left my pride behind a long long time ago.

once upon a time i felt embarrassed and ashamed to ask for help.

the idea of begging for money on the internet would've appeared humaliating to past me.

you know what makes it humiliating?

all the fucking garbage ppl who jump on every donation post


with some excuse or another for why the begger should just lie quietly down and die like the fucking animals we are.

why is it so fucking hard to just reblog or not. to donate or not. according to how you feel and what you value?

why are you turning someone's moment of begging, of desperation, into a game for scoring purity points?

of all the ppl i hate in this world

ur amongst the group i hate the most.
