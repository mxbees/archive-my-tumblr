holy shit. i just re-read a portion of the conclusion to my 2015 anthology of essays and...

wow. i'm being *ruthless*. and i'm sure i'll have even less friends after this.

i do think i'll post this section as a distinct blog post though.

bc i think this needs to be said. and i've been sitting on this feeling for a while in part bc i know that this will be the moment a lot of ppl i like and respect write me off.

so be it.

especially if my vilification actually results in *some* change for how teh Discourse is currently being conducted, it'll be worth it.

its literally been fucking *years* since that i've been holding my tongue about this.

but since 2015 is the year of burning bridges, i think i ought to get this out before the year ends.
