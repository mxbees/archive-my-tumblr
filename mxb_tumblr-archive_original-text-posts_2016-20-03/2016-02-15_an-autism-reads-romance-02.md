i just realized that if i really want to do this regularly, i actually think that making a vlog out of this might be fun. me sitting in front of a camera going "wtf?" lol.

today's book is [_Better than Chance_ by Lane Hayes](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20338332-better-than-chance). 

my bro was making fun of me yesterday bc i was complaining about how boring the book is. except that i was listening to it for the second time. he was all "why do u do this" and i was like "do u understand how special interests work".

anyway. the plot of the book in a sentence is: two butch masc4masc guys fall in love, one wants a Relationship but the other Does Not.

yes. that's literally the plot. 

now, the author builds tension bc the Relationship guy, whose the narrator, decides that he'll do a NSA fuck buddy thing with No-Relationship guy. And he spends the entire book being afraid that if he tells No-Relationship guy that he's falling in love and wants more, that he'll lose him.

this book is boring bc i don't fucking understand this problem.

just tell him how u feel! jesus christ. 

or don't and ffs stop whining about it. 

the other thing that baffles me is that he avoids his friends bc he doesn't want to tell them about it. and there is like. five fucking scenes where his friend is like "whats going on. i'm ur best friend and i don't want to see u hurt. blah blah"

ok. can anyone tell me what the fucking point of relationships is (romantic and otherwise) if those ppl aren't there for support? for, you know, people who can talk to and share problems with?

why bother?
