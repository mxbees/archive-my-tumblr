last thought before sleep. 

I honestly don't care about the opinion of any random person who very likely hasn't been a target of mass harassment.

i don't give a fuck about what anyone thinks about me and who I associate with if they haven't spent years watching as each and every single friend deals with years of harassment and abuse.
