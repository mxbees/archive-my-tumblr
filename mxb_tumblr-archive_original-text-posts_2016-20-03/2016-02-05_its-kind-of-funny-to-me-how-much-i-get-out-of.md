its kind of funny, to me, how much i get out of that three minute video.

like. it is so rich in terms of history.

in terms of inter-racial relations

solidarity, coalition, collaboration, whatever u want to call it.

it highlights an ongoing pattern of non-Black woc exploiting the labour of Black women

it teaches us how meanings of words change over time

how what was once Black and radical becomes sanitized and generalized and appropriated over time

how the discourse appears to be cyclical.

how little anything changes. even as everything changes.

it teaches us about history and its transmission.

gives us information about anti-Blackness and misogynoir

honestly. this one video. if you really think about it. if you really try to understand what she's communicating....

this one video can do more for you than most books by academics i've read.
