<blockquote><p>also. why cant poor people have things they like. why do we have to further dehumanize them by telling them that they deserve to starve if they spend money on luxuries</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a whole new level of stupid.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ok yeah go yell at someone living below the poverty line and tell them they should die of hunger because they bought their kid a 3ds.</p></blockquote>

<p>I’m sorry but this is ridiculous. If you barely have enough money to keep a roof over your head and feed and clothe your children, you shouldn’t prioritize a fucking 3ds. So you’d rather let your kids have a video game but no food in their stomachs? Not saying one should have to live in poverty, but come on for fucks sake, use your head!<br /></p></blockquote>

<p>how many times do i have to tell you idiots that there is no child out here whose parents opted to buy them games instead of food </p></blockquote>

what was said above...

but. 

as a poor person who literally just bought a 3ds

despite having barely enough money to pay rent, buy food, etc. and lives in extreme poverty

i did a bit of freelance work and crowdsourced games as birthday presents and now i have something that'll give me _years_ of entertainment and fun. 

but tell me, directly, assholes above, that i deserve to starve/lose my home/die just because i bought myself a 3ds.

go ahead. i'll be waiting.
