i just saw something talking about the stereotypes that asexuals have.

do aces even have stereotypes?

like. have we reached the critical threshold point of awareness such that there are stereotypes of aces?

or are talking about stereotypes within a limited scope (ie, within ~teh community~ but not the general public?).

(these are actual questions, btw. i don't pay enough attention to ace discourse to actually know the answers. mostly bc i hate about 90% of ace discourse. and before anyone jumps on me for this, [pls read this post about me and asexuality](http://mxb.ca/post/128350743944/i-want-to-spend-a-little-time-digging-into-my))
