did i really just have to see someone claim that intellectual labour isn't actually 'work'

like......

u realize there are whole professions that involve either intellectual labour and/or the teaching of it?

that ppl have to spend a lot of time in school getting the right credentials to be able to do this?

that it takes a lot of fucking time and effort to become so well-versed in a subject that u can teach it?

all so that u can have a 'conversation' or 'teach' an intellectually dishonest person on tumblr? 

like....

no. i'm sorry that some of us have a sense self-worth. and know that we deserve more and better than that.
