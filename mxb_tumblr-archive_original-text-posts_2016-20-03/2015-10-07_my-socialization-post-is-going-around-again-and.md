my socialization post is going around again and i'm getting some interesting responses...

like.

"are we ignoring how ppl treat other ppl? if ppl treat a trans girl like a boy, then she was socialized as a boy."

lol.

if everyone treated me like a turkey, that wouldn't mean i was socialized as a turkey.

jsyk.
