god. i was trying on some close earlier today bc i really need a new pair of pants.

found this jacket i really liked instead.

but... realized that i should hold off on buying a jacket for when i have tits

bc most of those things don't really fit me that well. and i'm not sure that the jacket would've had enough room for my tits.

one thing i hate about women's clothes is that my fucking arms are too big.

its been like four years since i've lifted weights but my body *loves* to hold on to muscle and definition.

same with pants.

i can sometimes barely pull womens pants on past my calves. 

soooo frustrating.
