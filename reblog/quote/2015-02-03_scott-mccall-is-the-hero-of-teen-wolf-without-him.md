<p>Scott McCall is the hero of Teen Wolf. Without him the show ceases to be as it is left without its center, its hero. Seeing a young Latino man step up and be the hero — not the villain, not the gangster, or the drug dealer, or the exotic plaything of the white heroine — but instead the hero is inspiring.</p>





<p>Teen Wolf is a silly show, with as many plot holes as Glee but there’s a lot to be said about the importance of Scott McCall in terms of representation. He’s the Captain America of the show: all  uncompromising goodness, self-sacrifice, and everyone’s moral center. He’s not there to be a stereotype or a token, Scott exists to be a hero.</p>
