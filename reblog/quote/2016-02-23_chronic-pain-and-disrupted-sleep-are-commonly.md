Chronic pain and disrupted sleep are commonly associated, and they share a clear cause-and-effect relationship. Pain fragments sleep, and poor sleep worsens the pain response. The prevalence of sleep disorders and the number of patients experiencing chronic pain continue to increase. Finally, pain and sleep disorders are among the most common reason for medical care. It is important to understand these conditions and appreciate the intimate relationship they share.

<p>It’s interesting because my sleep disorder first started in relationship to bipolar, and while that’s still the most prominent reason it’s definitely compounded by pain.</p><p>(via <a href="http://hoodoodyke.tumblr.com/" class="tumblr_blog">hoodoodyke</a>)

for me, i'm wondering if my sleep apnea is totally why i experience intermitent pain in various places (i know my frequent headaches are caused by it)
