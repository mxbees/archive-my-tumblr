<p>The main take away points are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Logic is a part of philosophy.</li>
<li>Logic is not based on objective, empirical ‘facts’ about the world.</li>
<li>Logic is not a theory of human reasoning.</li>
<li>Logic is not math (or computer science or any kind of science at all).</li>
<li>Logic has no general consensus as to what it is and how it works.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mm, I think it’s arguable that logic has subsections that can be classified as mathematics. (Not CS, even CS logic is mathematics.)</p>

<p>But it should be noted that the subsection of logic that does entail mathematics is specifically a study in the correct way to present a mathematical proof.</p>

the point about logic not being math is really about countering the logical positivist project of reducing math to logic (which is clearer in the post). so like, in this context, it makes sense to assert that logic is def. not math since math isn't reducible to logic.

i don't disagree that there is some math in logic or that they aren't connected in some important ways... just that they aren't the same thing.
