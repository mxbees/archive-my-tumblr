<p>I know some ppl on tumblr are using Open Dyslexic bc it claims to be ‘easier’ for dyslexics to read. It’s just that… the font is fucking ugly.</p>

<p>Also turns out that the font isn’t actually better (its not worse, but its also not better).</p>

<p>But the recommendations are also kind of scattered everywhere, so I thought I’d collect it for others interested in web accessibility.</p>

<p>“Letter-spacing, e.g. r, n together rn should not look like m, (‘modern’ may scan as, or sound like, ‘modem’.)”<br><br>This line reminds me of a day ago when I read “whom” as “whorn” and was extremely confused for the next three reads.<br><br>I actually never bothered to note which fonts I found easier to read. I just go with those I find aesthetically pleasing, if I choose other than the default (so it’s usually Arial for me, as I’m writing essays most of the time), though perhaps that subconsciously overlaps with what I find readable. </p>

<p>lol. when i read that part i totally thought of you and 'whom' :D<br/><br/>honestly? all i really wanted to convey is that ppl really don't need to use those unbelievably ugly 'designed for dyslexics' fonts. since they don't do anything.</p>
