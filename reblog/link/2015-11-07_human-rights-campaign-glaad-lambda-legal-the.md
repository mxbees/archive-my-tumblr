<p>Wooow</p>

<p>Note that they don’t talk about trans men at all in their petition and only talk about scary “men pretending to be women invading spaces.” They don’t hate transgender people, just trans women, and the idea of being associated with us disgusts them.</p>
<p>It’s evil. This idea is evil and the people that support it are evil because they want to smother us and make us unknown and invisible so that nobody notices that we’re being killed on an almost weekly basis. It’s transmisogynistic garbage, plain and simple. It’s outspoken bigotry promoting even further violence against an already marginalized group of people struggling to simply exist.</p>

there is something deeply amusing about this petition (yes, i read the entire text). 

the level to which the apocryphal white cis gay/lesbian history is believed to be true....

the ridiculousness of targetting organizations that only very recently began to do *anything* for trans women (and still barely do a single fucking thing)

the fact that someone put a tweet of nero supporting this (which if u know who he is, should really tell you all you need to know about this)

the fact that they think they need to petition to maintain the status quo.

deeply. amusing.
