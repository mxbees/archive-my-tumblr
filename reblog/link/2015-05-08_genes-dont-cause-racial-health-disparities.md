<blockquote><div>On April 24, 2003, shortly after the <a href="https://www.genome.gov/11006943">completion</a> of the human genome project, its director Francis Collins and his team <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v422/n6934/full/nature01626.html">posed</a> 15 grand challenges to the scientific community. They dared researchers to harness the genome to crack puzzles of biology, health, and society. In particular, they called for genome-based tools to close health disparities. Since then, the United States has <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/472">pumped</a> more than $1 billion a year into genomics research. What do we have to show for it?<p>“What we found in the literature published from 2007 to 2013 was basically nothing,” said Jay Kaufman, the lead author of the first <a href="http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/02/28/aje.kwu319.abstract">study</a> to examine available genetic data for evidence that explains a major racial-health disparity. For many years, researchers speculated that what they couldn’t explain about disparities must be the fingerprint of some mysterious <a href="http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/32/5/813.full">genetic component</a>. But since they are now able to scan the entire genome, this speculation appears both lazy and wrong. When it comes to why many black people die earlier than white people in the U.S., Kaufman and his colleagues show we’ve been looking for answers in the wrong places: We shouldn’t be looking in the twists of the double helix, but the grinding inequality of the environment.</p></div></blockquote>

<p>the year is 2015 and scientists are _still_ looking for a biological/scientific explanation for systemic racism/white supremacy.<br/><br/>this is why the stuff i've been saying about early scientific racism matters. <br/><br/>racism, as science, isn't gone. they are still looking for reasons why, for example, Black ppl are themselves responsible for their own health disparities (via their genes) rather than spending any time or money into examining why white supremacy doesn't value Black life. </p>
