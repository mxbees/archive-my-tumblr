<p>i agree full heartedly with this.</p>

<p>not only is the analysis correct (in that MRAs are a bigger concern for trans women than radfems)</p>

<p>but in terms of the relative power and sway.</p>

<p>like. as vile as a lot of radfems are and can be&#8230;.</p>

<p>it is important to note that a lot of their contemporary talk/focus is actually on sex workers (which, yes, overlaps significantly with twoc).</p>

<p>actually look at the topics that top radfems focus on&#8230; when janice raymond spoke at the VPL last year (two  years ago?) her talk was about sex work. gail dines, the radfem tumblr loves to reblog? talks about porn (ie, sex workers). the younger generation of radfems? like meghan murphy? FOCUSES ON SEX WORK.</p>

<p>outside of rhetoric, radfems have largely abandoned the field re: trans women and gender.</p>

<p>moreover, their influence in terms of policy and other such things is pretty small at this point.</p>

<p>but they still significantly impact policy that concerns sex workers.</p>

<p>and i notice that it is usually white trans women who are content to ignore this and still act like radfems are the biggest worry&#8230;..</p>
