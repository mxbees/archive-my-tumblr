<blockquote><p>I’m SCREAMING someone stop the white trans girls please.</p></blockquote>

<p>omfg. why.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Male-to-female transgender people rely on props like clothes, shoes, make-up and hairstyles to create the gender identity they want to portray to the world because most of the time their bodies alone are unable to do that.  There are a few lucky ones who don’t have to do a thing to put across a female persona, but most trans women have to work hard at it.</p>
  
  <p>The danger for trans women is that if wearing what are traditionally women’s clothes becomes the norm for men too, then trans women will no longer be able to rely on these props to help them display a female gender identity - and for many, that could be a serious problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>someone eject her into space immediately.</p>

<p>There’s so many people being erased in this I can’t even start and the rebuttal article isn’t much better</p>

<p>this is what happens when you let the whites take over the gender playground.</p>

bleh. 

i mean. can't he just live and not have to be a pawn in white ppl's gender crap?

(answer: apparently not.)

i think, between these two articles, this is pretty much everything i hate about the white trans community.
