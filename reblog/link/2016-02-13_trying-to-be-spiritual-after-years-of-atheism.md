its okay. i do have one person i can occassionally discuss this stuff with.

and, tbh, i am actually ok with where i am right now. 

i still feel like i'm doing what they want me to do. and i leave offerings to thank them for the guidance and help. seems good enough for now.

i am, for real, actually thinking about going to mass on sundays. at least mass tends to be a lot shorter than sda church services.
