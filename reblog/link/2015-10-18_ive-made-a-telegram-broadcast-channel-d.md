<p>i’m feeling a little ‘meh’ on tumblr and twitter these days. and i’d like to try something different.</p>

<p><a href="http://telegram.org">telegram</a> is a messaging client/service. so far it is my favourite (if only because they have linux support which is pretty fucking rare – and makes this one of the few cross-platform messaging services in existence). i also find it really fast and reliable.</p>

<p>it is kind of like whatsapp, since you can tie your number too it. but i like it more bc you can also use a username, if you don’t want to share your number with everyone. its also free and not owned by facebook…</p>

<p>anyway, channels are like they sound. if you subscribe, you’ll get notifications whenever i post something (you can’t respond, though). i actually can’t tell (since i’m the admin) whether or not it gives you info to message me directly. i might put this in the channel description.</p>

<p>i know that most people are generally… unwilling to switch services or try new ones (unless there is already a critical mass of people they know. but telegram definitely fits more into how i’ve been using twitter at least (where i just send messages and don’t interact that often with people). i also think that this is a place where harassment will be harder to experience since people subscribed to the channel can’t actually reply to stuff.</p>

<p>also, this is a pretty reliable way to get a hold of me bc i’m always signed in. username: ninatee.</p>

<p>re: contacting me too.</p>

<p>i mean. there is email and all that. but… i can’t use skype which i know is pretty much where all my friends are and it makes me sad :(</p>

<p>*shakes fist at skype*</p>

<p>i’ve also tried using gchat but a lot of ppl have moved off of that too. and i don’t like it as much as telegram anyway (bc fuck google).</p>

<p>er. also. you can share things like pictures and other media via your channel. not just writing.</p>

i feel like i ought to also make it clear that tumblr will *still* be the place where my blog posts are posted.

this is my 'main' blog now.

so if u don't subscribe to the telegram channel, you aren't going to miss out on a bunch of my writing.

it might just mean that stuff i usually tag 'the life of an ordinary bakla' will get posted there. and maybe my more trivial tweets. idk. still figuring it all out.
