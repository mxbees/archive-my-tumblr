<p>me: starting to get really fucking annoyed at the puberty blocker post going around…</p>
<p>why?</p>
<p>well….</p>
<p>the assumptions of the post</p>
<p>like. yes. obviously all trans ppl (young or old) should have easy and sufficient access to healthcare (trans&#8230;</p>

<p>How can all this be said and still skim right over how important finding an emotional balance is. Hrt, even SRS is most likely not going fix that. The body is just an extension of us, an important one, but not the whole.</p><p>I started transitioning at 22 when I couldn&#8217;t stand waiting any longer and I had run out of self imposed excuses not to. It took me almost four years after I started to realize that my body wasn&#8217;t going to make me happy, that I need to make me happy.</p><p>If we can ease even a small amount of that turmoil for a young transperson it should be available, it&#8217;s not about dismantling a social construct, it&#8217;s about supporting that young individual and helping them be happy if that is the path they want. Information and knowledgeable peers need to be available.</p><p>Society will always be fucked up and change takes dissemination of information and understanding and that all takes time. I&#8217;m not going to trade being progressive for being pinheaded.</p><p>I didn&#8217;t transition to fit in, I don&#8217;t fit in and I don&#8217;t really care to. I&#8217;m not exactly a subtle individual, I have been bullied and threatened for my weight, my personality, for being too effeminate, Hell I&#8217;ve been bullied for having common sense. Then after transitioning I&#8217;ve been bullied for not being effeminate enough, for not acting differently enough, for not wanting to wear makeup (seriously, what?!). <br />It has taught me that any deviation from the norm is going to be meet with resistance by people who don&#8217;t understand it. I didn&#8217;t transition for them or for those reasons. I transitioned to be that much more comfortable with myself. I&#8217;m not going to be jaded about my life just because some parts have been less than ideal and I&#8217;m absolutely not going to tell a kid that transitioning early and passing well is a copout, if anything it&#8217;s a pleasant side effect of embracing themselves.</p></blockquote>

me: writes a post that is 100% about how the trans experience isn't just physical/about our bodies

response above: "omg! what about emotional balance!?"

me: explicitely writes "all trans ppl should have easy access to health care"

response above: "zomg! hdu say it is about dismantling social constructs, when we should do stuff to easy body dysphoria!"

sofriel: "yeah, like pushing the white medicalized model of transness is an assimilationist/colonial position"

response above: "hdu! say that early transition is a cop-out"

u know...

go fuck urself. 

and fuck ur white individualist approach to this while still managing to reify the medical model of transness
