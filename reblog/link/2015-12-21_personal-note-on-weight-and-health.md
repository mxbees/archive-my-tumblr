<p>a personal reflection on how i’ve been trying to navigate my need to change my lifestyle and improve my health, but also unlearning fatphobia.</p>

<p>(more or less how i’m trying to move away from a shame based approach.</p>

<p>If it’s not distressing to talk about:<br>How do you conceptualize being fat VS chubby VS over weight?</p>

for me? i'm honestly basing this on what i've heard fat/chubby people say about their experiences.

like. i'd say fat to me is when ppl glare at you for taking up too much space when you sit down on the bus. and i'm definitely not at this point.

maybe chubby is the threshold for when random people (not just doctors) start giving you unsolicited advice about how to loose weight

(this is likely the threshold for fat too, i'm not really wanting to make a strong distinction between fat and chubby, tbh, more that... i'm trying to make a distinction re; overweight vs fat mainly based on my own experiences? like for my own self, i became overweight the moment doctors and nurses started attributing most/all of my health problems to my weight... despite many of them pre-dating my current weight.)

more than anything, i guess i'm not trying to equivocate my current experience with that of fat people who are unambiguously so and experience the ramifications of this in many different parts of their life.

with every pound i gain, i'm totally heading in that direction, but i'm not there yet.
