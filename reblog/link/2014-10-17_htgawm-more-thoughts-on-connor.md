<p>so i’m only up to ep 3, where connor does his big outing of the Black bi guy.</p>
<p>which is shitty in its own respect and lots of ppl have been talking about this</p>
<p>but i’m also very interested to see</p>
<p>that of the two men he’s been sexually linked to on the show</p>
<p>both are men of color. One Asian and…</p>

<p>I think you might be seeing something that isn’t there due to your past experiences.</p>

<p>Sorry that that sort of thing happened to you, but Connor’s relationships seem to be ones of circumstance.</p>

<p>Oliver could hack, Aiden was willing. </p>

<p>They just happen to be men of color.</p>

<p>Connor outed Aiden because he’s a shit person, it’s a power thing, not a race thing.</p></blockquote>

<p>"i guess not all powr things are race things"<br/><br/>i really need you to reflect on why you think that race is irrelevant <br/><br/>it always matters. it will never not matter that connor is a white man and the guy's he uses and abuses are men of colour. <br/><br/>"Aiden was willing"<br/><br/>Did he consent to being outed? Yes, he had sex, but conner maliciously outed him. this is a dangerous and fucked up thing for a white man to do to a Black man. </p>
