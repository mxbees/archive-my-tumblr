<p>Question, if you did feel like most of these were normal things, what should you do?</p></blockquote>

it depends...

if you think this is normal and you are still living with your parents... i guess try and survive until you aren't? it is really hard to try and heal when you are being hurt/traumatized everyday. 

beyond this...

if u aren't living with your parents and you think this is you, then. well. i guess you start healing, whatever this means for you.

the first step, for me, was actually and truly really assimilating the knowledge that these things aren't normal. that they are _abuse_ (or _neglect_). 

for me, grwoing up with the idea that this stuff is normal, made the above realization that i was _abused_ and _neglected_ as a child fucking groundbreaking. it blew my fucking mind. 

and just getting to a place where i could understand my life from this angle was... hard enough. but so fucking important.

idk. idk. 

i have nothing really else to offer beyond that since everyone's journey for healing is different.
