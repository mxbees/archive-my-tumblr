<blockquote>
<p>sooooâ€¦</p> <p>here is a thing i find interesting. i reblogged two posts by disabledqueerdyke today about Rita Hester.</p> <p>one mentions that TDoR was created in response to her murder</p> <p>and the other notes that we need to recognize that the Black community has a lot to do with knowledge of her life and death</p> </blockquote>

<p>hours later and the TDoR one is in four digits at 2000+ and the one about the key role her community (the BLACK one) played in remembering her sitting at 99.<br/><br/>like i said<br/><br/>TRANSPARENT</p>
