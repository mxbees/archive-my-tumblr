in case anyone was curious, this was one of the reasons why i was motivated to write my recent post about decolonization and how it has receeded in importance in my philosophy over the past few years.

they actually work really well together. read this, its the 'other' perspective (ie, from the 'homeland' vs mine which is from a diaspora perspective). 

taken in concert, they really highlight some important conceptual problems with how many people conceive of 'decolonization' nowadays.
