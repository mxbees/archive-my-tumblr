<p>This would reduce the overall work a great deal…</p>

<p>since for $100, you’re able to make a print-ready pdf. i also wouldn’t have to maintain a server/hosting account (which is like… $400/year as it is + all my labour).</p>

<p>i guess, even if i just look at the yearly costs… if i switched to using pressbooks to host the biyuti publishing catalogue, this means i’d automatically have the money to pay for four books to be ready for printing….</p>

<p>which, given that four books, given current available labour is more books that we could actually publish in a year, i guess this would be one way to reduce both costs and labour?</p>

<p>hmm…..</p>

<p>feedback would be super welcome.</p>

<p>(you can’t read any of the books, more interested in feedback on the catalogue page. i’m kind of thinking that if i shutdown the biyuti publishing site with the subscriptions, move to patreon, and then give out subscriptions to the web-books from there, i could make a fairly smooth transition?)</p>

<p>It’s a little odd that all the different cover images are different sizes. The text in the hover effect isn’t particularly legible on most of the covers. Having two tag filters doesn’t make much sense, especially since there are only 4 books displayed.</p>

<p>That being said, I like the simplicity of the overall layout.</p>

Yeah. I was just using whatever images were around, but I'd make sure (if this were to go live) to make the covers all the same size.

Not sure if I can customize the hover text. I caught that problem too and was like...

why.

There are more than four books, but I wanted to get some feedback before I uploaded everything.

I also didn't know how the tag filter worked, so I'd be inclined to change the taxonomy somewhat.

like maybe have Tag 1 be author names and Tag 2 be genre or something.
