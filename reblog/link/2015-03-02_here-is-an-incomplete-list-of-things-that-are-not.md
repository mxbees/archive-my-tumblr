<p>um if you identify with several of these , do you seek help or take a nap? for real tell me</p></blockquote>

are you still with your parents? is help something you can safely seek? 

what you do depends on your situation.

obviously, it is always a good thing to be able to remove yourself from abusive situations and/or toxic parents. 

but...

just as obviously, this isn't possible (at least immediately) for a lot of people. 

what you should do also depends on which ones you identified with.

like...

if you are experiencing medical neglect (ie, your parents are denying you access to healthcare) this is something a lot of child protective services will take pretty seriously. 

if you are always afraid of your parent(s) but they don't, for example, actually _threaten_ you or anything or physically hurt you... this will be harder to convince an agency or whatever that you are being harmed, since a lot of emotional abusse like this is 'invisible' and society does this thing where it refuses to believe kids about our own experiences with our parents (gaslighting writ large). 

idk.

for me...

just knowing some of this stuff while i was still at home would've helped me, internally at least, combat some of the abuse.
