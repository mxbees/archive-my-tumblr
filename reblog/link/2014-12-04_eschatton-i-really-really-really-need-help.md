<p>I really, really, REALLY need help, I’m desperate, this is for tomorrow (December 5th) at 8.30 am and I’m getting BOOSTED if I don’t have it done, it’s for a final.</p>
<p>I worked on an After Effects animation for a final thing in my school’s computers. I literally only had to export it and it was done, the whole thing was done except for that, and they kicked me out of the computer’s labs because they were closing before I could export the video.</p>
<p>Now, I installed After Effects in my computer, but the computers at my school have the 12.2.1 version, and my computer can’t install that update, so the file isn’t opening correctly.</p>
<p>All I need is for someone who has that version to open the file for me, and export it. PLEASE.</p>
<p>If you can’t help, at least reblog this or something because I’m DOOMED if I can’t get help on this.</p>
