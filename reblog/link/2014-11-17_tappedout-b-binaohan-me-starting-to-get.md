<p>ugh. <br/><br/>i was thinking about the function of that post as being 'informative'...<br/><br/>u know the OP didn't even link to the evidence that hormone blockers are safe, yeah? <br/><br/>and obviously, i know what the intended purpose of the post was<br/><br/>i also know that the post and how it is framed directly contributes to my oppression...<br/><br/>so. <br/><br/>yeah. </p>
