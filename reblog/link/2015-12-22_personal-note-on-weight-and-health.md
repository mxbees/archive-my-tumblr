<p>a personal reflection on how i’ve been trying to navigate my need to change my lifestyle and improve my health, but also unlearning fatphobia.</p>

<p>(more or less how i’m trying to move away from a shame based approach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it’s not distressing to talk about:<br>How do you conceptualize being fat VS chubby VS over weight?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>for me? i’m honestly basing this on what i’ve heard fat/chubby people say about their experiences.</p>

<p>like. i’d say fat to me is when ppl glare at you for taking up too much space when you sit down on the bus. and i’m definitely not at this point.</p>

<p>maybe chubby is the threshold for when random people (not just doctors) start giving you unsolicited advice about how to loose weight</p>

<p>(this is likely the threshold for fat too, i’m not really wanting to make a strong distinction between fat and chubby, tbh, more that… i’m trying to make a distinction re; overweight vs fat mainly based on my own experiences? like for my own self, i became overweight the moment doctors and nurses started attributing most/all of my health problems to my weight… despite many of them pre-dating my current weight.)</p>

<p>more than anything, i guess i’m not trying to equivocate my current experience with that of fat people who are unambiguously so and experience the ramifications of this in many different parts of their life.</p>

<p>with every pound i gain, i’m totally heading in that direction, but i’m not there yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dunno, I don’t think calling urself fat is equivocating? Idk, maybe it’s a cultural/language thing (Canadian weight/body politics is not a thing I’m used to) but I’ve always thought of fat as being like…a more ambiguous term. Idk. I do get mad at very skinny or thin people who think they’re fat (like if you’re 6′ and 120 pounds you’re skinny, lbr), but that’s not…the same thing. Idk, language around this is weird, it’s very murky stuff.</p>

yeah. i'm still very much trying to feel my way into all of this, given that i'm a new entrant. so i'm proceeding cautiously.

i think part of the problem is the... inherent trans/misogyny of some of the measures of size.

like. when i started predominantly wearing women's clothes, i jumped sizes from a small to XL, so yeah, i'm having trouble with clothing but i can't tell if it is a body shape or size issue.

its also...at my height, what i weighed maybe 10lbs ago was... a little overweight for a 'guy' but like. i just realized is pretty much considered 'fat' for a girl? except that my body doesn't look that different?

its weird. i'm still processing it all (as this post and ensuing discussion demonstrates, esp as i try manage the health issue).
