Given the aging population in Canada, we want to continue to build upon those efforts.</p><p> The current generation of older LGBTQ people have experienced a lifetime of discrimination due to
 their sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression and 
they face very specific challenges as they age:</p><p> - They are less likely to seek health care when they need it;</p><p>
 - They often do not disclose their sexual orientation and/or gender 
identity and expression to their care providers for fear of 
discrimination;</p><p> - They report more feelings of isolation from their communities; </p><p>
 - They are at a higher risk for negative health outcomes later in life,
 including depression, suicide, substance abuse, smoking, etc. Â </p><p> (Brotman &amp; Ryan, 2008)</p><p>
 The 519 Education and Training Team offer workshops and resources that 
support safe, welcoming and inclusive care environments for LGBTQ older 
people. The training supports organizations and individuals to 
understand the needs of older LGBTQ people. Workshops will help 
participants to:</p><p> - Identify and discuss reasons an older LGBTQ 
person may be distrustful of the health or social care systems and/or 
reluctant to seek the care they need;</p><p> - Demonstrate and share an empathetic understanding of the barriers faced by older LGBTQ people;</p><p> - Make appropriate use of pronouns;</p><p> - Propose ways to foster a safe and LGBTQ-inclusive care environment for older people, their friends and chosen families. </p><p> For more information about training and resources, please contact: </p><p> Steven Little</p><p> Manager, Education and Training</p><p> 416-355-6772</p><p> slittle@the519.org </p><p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/respectyourelders">#respectyourelders</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/nobystanders">#nobystanders</a></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>i find myself looking at this and thinking 'zomg the cute'<br/><br/>but then i remember that old white ppl tend to be SUPER FUCKING RACIST<br/><br/>and then i see that there is only one Black person in these photos....<br/><br/>i wish these things actually did a better job of connecting to facts and reality.<br/><br/>so. we know from one study that Black people (esp. women/femmes/trans women/trans femnine) are far more likely to identify as 'queer' in some way than any other race.<br/><br/>we also (this has been going  around on tumblr recently) know that the real face of elderly poverty is overwhelmingly women of colour...........<br/><br/>cross these two intersections with growing old....<br/><br/>also knowing just how many Black trans seniors/elders i know who are _struggling_ with continued poverty and the health impacts of a lifetime of this<br/><br/>this photo set should be inverse. _one_ white person to many Black people and other iaopoc. <br/><br/>bc. you know what? <br/><br/>iaopoc elders are far less likely to have pensions and other shit that, yes, will help ameliorate the 'lifetime' of oppression of these white ppl. <br/><br/>but srsly.<br/><br/>fuck white ppl. including old white ppl.</p>
