<blockquote><p>[text reads: You&#8217;re welcome to name my name. Gender identity is fundamentally different from sexual orientation, as trans advocates are quick to &#8220;correct&#8221; us all if we don&#8217;t properly genuflect to the differences. Yet trans advocates decided to forcibly try to commandeer the gay rights movement and merge the two traits out of political expediency. It&#8217;s as if non-black gays and lesbians decided to invade the black civil rights movement and order it to never use the word &#8220;black&#8221; without also using the word &#8220;gay&#8221; and to make gay rights an equal part of the mission of black civil rights organizations. No one should be surprised that people resent being commandeered, nor should there be any surprise at push back when the forcibly attached tail tries to wag the targeted dog. I agree with pretty much every public policy reform promoted by trans advocates, and I was more than happy to work on those issues as an ally. But I won&#8217;t be forced into an artificial merger, in which we&#8217;re caustically attacked if we even utter the word &#8220;gay&#8221; in our own movement. Nor will I be dictated to by intruders to the movement, be ordered to self-identify with the preposterous malformation &#8220;cisgender,&#8221; or pretend that the politics of trans rights are the same as the politics of gay rights. I&#8217;m happy to lend a hand when asked. I will never be bullied. Spitting bile in my face is not the way to get my support.

<p>so the d00d is a racist white cisgay (anti-Blackness, hello!)</p>

<p>look at this:</p>

<p>we are intruders into the movement that we started</p>

<p>we have &#8216;commandeered&#8217; the ~gay rights~ movement from</p>

<p>cis gays and cis lesbians</p>

<p>this is why</p>

<p>'fuck ur umbrella'</p>

<p>but also why newer attempts for inclusion like &#8216;mogaii&#8217; are so fucking terrible.</p></blockquote>
