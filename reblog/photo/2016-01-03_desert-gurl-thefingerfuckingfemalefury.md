i hate everything about this

(except for desert-gurl's comment)

hrt is magic bc it'll make u look like a thing, conventionally attractive white cis girl!

(but only if you happen to a thing white person to begin with)

if u haven't transitioned, it isn't too late!

(bc doing hrt and transitioning are the same. if you don't do hrt, you don't transition. fuck all the girls too poor, who just don't want to, have health problems preventing them, whatever. you can still transition! all u need is access to a doctor and money for hormones! uwu)

i'm so inspired

(yet another day of teh ~community~ making me feel like my body and choices aren't valid. thanks. much appreciated. fuck u all.)
