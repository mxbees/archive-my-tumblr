<p>[Image: A picture of Stevie Wonder talking into a microphone with text on top which reads</p>
<p>“We need to make every single thing accessible to every single person with a disability.” - Stevie Wonder]<br></p>
</blockquote>

i think this is the greatest thing ever. everything happening in this post is so meta.

the huffington post brands this image and Stevie Wonder's words. but they put it into an image with no description. thus rendering it inaccessible to people like Stevie Wonder.

so some random person on the internet needs to provide the free labour that the huffpo *could've* easily done in their attempt to appear like a progressive media outlet that cares, rather than just another capitalist piece of shit exploiting a Black disabled man.

:D
