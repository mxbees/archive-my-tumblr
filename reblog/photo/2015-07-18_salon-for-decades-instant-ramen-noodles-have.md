<blockquote><blockquote><p>For decades, instant ramen noodles have been a culinary staple for cash-poor college students, young working professionals and even prisoners. Yet ramen noodles are a main culprit of deforestation due to the high amount of unsustainable palm oil used to make them. While several large food corporations have committed to eliminating conflict palm oil from their supply chains, two of the worldâ€™s biggest instant noodle producers, Nissin Foods Holdings and Toyo Suisan Kaisha (Maruchan), both Japanese firms, have <a href="http://action.sumofus.org/a/noodles-palm-oil/?sub=homepage">failed to adopt</a> responsible palm oil policies, according to SumOfUs, a non-profit consumer advocacy group.<br /></p></blockquote><h2><b><a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/07/18/ramen_noodles_partner/?utm_source=Tumblr&amp;utm_medium=Tumblr%20Share&amp;utm_campaign=Tumblr">Bad news for broke college students, even worse news for the planet </a></b></h2></blockquote>

<p></p><p>i fucking hate this environmental click bait shit.<br/><br/>in the article itself, it points out how palm oil is used in many, many different kinds of things. <br/><br/>the way this title reads, poor ppl need to make better, more 'ethical' food choices. like. of course. deforestation in SE Asia is the sole responsibility of poor ppl. <br/><br/>we, as poor ppl, are totally the ones who are doing this and if we'd just fucking stop being poor and eating cheap food, maybe we could save the environment.<br/><br/>so . we all better be ready to starve to fucking death bc apparently our individual consumer choice is threatening the planet. </p>
