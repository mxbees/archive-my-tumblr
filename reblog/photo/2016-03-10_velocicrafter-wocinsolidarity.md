<p>Re-reblogging to add some commentary that I think is really important to this case and when thinking about the social construction of race and whiteness in the United States (most of this information can be found in the link above but also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Bhagat_Singh_Thind">Wikipedia page which is quite extensive</a>):</p>
<p>Like many Supreme Court cases that were/are about civil rights concerning marginalized racial/ethic groups (remember that historically this has also included ethnic European groups like Eastern Europeans, Italians, Irish, etc. that were accepted / assimilated into whiteness) this was about the question of “who is considered white, and therefore worthy of rights in the eyes of the law?” </p>
<p>In this particular court case, Thind  argued that South Asians should be able to file for naturalization because they counted as “free white persons” (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalization_Act_of_1906">Naturalization Act of 1906</a>). His argument was basically around language (”Highlighting the linguistic ties between Indo-Aryan speakers and Europeans was done to characterize Thind as being a white person”). I don’t know anything about the caste system or prejudice within India to comment extensively, but apparently he also argued his whiteness on the basis of being a “high-caste Hindu, of full Indian blood” and said really sexist/racist about Indian women. </p>
<p>Anyway, SCOTUS determined that South Asians were not in fact “Caucasian” (the “scientific” classification at the time for white people) and so did not count as “free white persons” and so were not protected under the Naturalization Act of 1906. Thus, South Asians were not allowed to become citizens.<br></p>
<p>This is VERY similar to a case that happened only months before, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozawa_v._United_States">Ozawa v. United States</a>. Ozawa attempted to file for naturalization under the idea that Japanese folks (and I think East Asians generally?) counted as “free white person.” He lost. </p>
<p>Anyway, I added this because I think it’s super important to think about historical events in their entire context. This is a prime example of what people mean when they say that race is a social construct.  </p>
<p>This all being said I’m not an expert, so if anyone knows more about this and wants to correct any of this please do. </p>

<p>white people this is why nobody trusts you</p>

here are some corrections and additional historical context:

1. this case has nothing to do with white ppl like the irish, italians, greeks, etc. they are and always have been legally white in the united states.
2. this case wasn't about 'who was considered white' but whether or not Indians were considered white. this is an important distinction bc part of the evidence that Thind used was Johann Blumenbach's racial classification: which had South Asians listed as 'caucausian'.
3. This case is significant bc it represents the end of the death grip that scientific racism had on the world.
4. why? bc the judges argued that no one at that time actually meant Indians when they said 'caucasian' thus going against the main scientific expert (blumenbach) in favour of contemporary (non-scientific) usage.
5. this is important bc the ozawa case was decided using blumenbach's racial classification. he tried to argue that bc his skin was white/fair that he was white. but since blumenbach classified him as a 'mongoloid' he could not be white. end of story.
6. this also misses the fact that for 13 years prior to this case South Asians *were* able to be citizens bc, scientifically, they were caucasian. this case revoked that whiteness and stripped a bunch of american citizens of their citizenship (ie, all the south asians who'd already been naturalized). 
7. what this reclassification also meant was that south asians were suddenly oppressed by the racist laws of the time. like the fact that bc of this case they weren't allowed to own property anymore. and other fun things.

like... the above explanation really misses out on a lot of the nuances that made this case interesting and how it changed the legal classification of race in the US.
