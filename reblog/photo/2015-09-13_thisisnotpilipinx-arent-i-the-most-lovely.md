<p>aren&rsquo;t i the most lovely trans pinay in the world? lol.</p>
<p>i figure why not submit a fun picture since one of my favourite things about being pilipinx is how much fun, joy, and laughing i&rsquo;ve done with my family over the years.</p>
<p>and while i&rsquo;m mixed and very light skinned, i don&rsquo;t know my white family and my dad raised me to always be proud to be tagalog and of my culture and family. i carry this pride with me always.</p>
