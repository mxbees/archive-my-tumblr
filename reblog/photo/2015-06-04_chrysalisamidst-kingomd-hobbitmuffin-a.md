<p>yes....<br/><br/>but also no. <br/><br/>'poor trans ppl'<br/><br/>um......<br/><br/>'poor trans women of colour'<br/><br/>most of whom are Black trans women of colour. who yes, are often poor.<br/><br/>and like, look at this person's twitter profile, they look like a white afab person.<br/><br/>which explains why they've happily erased the race and gender of the 'poor trans ppl' who are murdered...<br/><br/>and, now, looking at this, maybe they aren't just talking about murder and violence. <br/><br/>but then. when we look at which 'poor trans ppl' get actually get hashtags when they are dead? white trans ppl. very rarely do i see dead trans women of colour actually get even a hashtag (beyond the few people who always care)<br/><br/>almost like whiteness plays a role in which trans ppl, dead or alive, get hashtags and media attention......</p>
