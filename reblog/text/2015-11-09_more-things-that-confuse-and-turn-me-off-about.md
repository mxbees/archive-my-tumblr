title: More things that confuse and turn me off about this anti-manifesto, and why
  it just sounds like neocolonialism

<p><br></p>
<p>“Gender = coercive and performative, and completely socially constructed for a system of structural oppression and power.”</p>
<p>Er, not inherently. </p>
<p>And why is performative inherently bad?</p>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote><p>“ Gender must punish deviance, thus gender must go.””<br></p></blockquote>
<p>Again, not necessarily….</p>
<blockquote><p>““No, a return to a simpler and smaller understanding of gender (even if supposedly material conception) will not do. It is the very normative grouping of bodies in the first place which we push back against. Neither contraction nor expansion will save us. Our only path is that of destruction.””</p></blockquote>
<p>Literally. Abolish gender. Where is the room for indigenous genders here? I keep seeing indigenous people say that they don’t mean abolish all gender forever, but instead return to cultural gender, but that is literally not what this is saying, at all. It’s not saying abolish sex, or abolish the coercive western and colonialist conceptualization of sex and its stronghold on political and medical systems. It’s saying get rid of everything, forever.</p>
<blockquote><p>““At the heart of our gender abolition is a negativity. <b>We seek not to abolish gender so that a true self can be returned to; there is no such self</b>.””</p></blockquote>
<p>Literally where is the room for indigenous gender?</p>
<p>I personally find the terminology of “antihumanism” fascinating coming from non-Black people, as the Black experience dictates that Black people, unlike other people of color, are not only non-human or subhuman, but in fact anti-human. The antithesis to what is humanity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The liberal feminist<b> is not aware of the ways power creates gender, and thus clings to gender as a means of legitimizing themselves in the eyes of powe</b>r. They rely on trying to use various systems of knowledge (genetic sciences, <b>metaphysical claims about the soul</b>, kantian ontology) in order to prove to power they can operate within it.</p>
<p>The gender nihilist, the gender abolitionist, looks at the system of gender itself and see’s the violence at its core. <b>We say no to a positive embrace of gender. We want to see it gone. </b>We know appealing to the current formulations of power is always a liberal trap. We refuse to legitimize ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I said before and will continue to say, this sounds coercive, neocolonialist, violent, and erasive. And, ironically, quite condescending and patronizing.</p>
<blockquote><p>

With this attitude at the forefront, it is not merely certain formulations of identity politics which we seek to combat, but the need for identity altogether. Our claim is that the ever expanding list of personal preferred pronouns, the growing and ever more nuanced labels for various expressions of sexuality and gender, and the attempt to construct new identity categories more broadly is not worth the effort.

<br></p></blockquote>
<p>I think the part about the effort is one of the few things I can agree on, but my conceptualization of the cause and solution is different. </p>
<blockquote><p>

Thus it is with reckless abandon that we refuse to postulate about what a future might hold, and what we might be within that future. A rejection of meaning, a rejection of known possibility, a rejection of being itself. Nihilism. That is our stance and method.

<br></p></blockquote>
<p>Again, this brings me back to how Blackness is perceived and was conceptualized. I find it odd that other, non-Black people are trying to achieve what was coercively put upon slave-descent Black people. </p>

<p>uggggh. now i might end up reading this manifesto myself. <br/><br/>but all of this.</p>
