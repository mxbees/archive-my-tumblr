<p>holy fuck. i’m trying to organize my steven universe episodes.</p>

<p>and there are like… four different orderings to the seasons online.</p>

<p>wtf.</p>

after spending *way* too much time. i have them all in the 'right' order.

except that it probably *isn't* the right order.

what is the right order? no one seems to know. 

what a fucking mess.
