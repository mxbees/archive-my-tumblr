<blockquote><p>its taken a few years.</p>

<p>but i really and truly understand what some ppl have been talking about.</p>

<p>that feeling of seeing ur words/concepts/frameworks spoken by other mouths</p>

<p>words that u sometimes got harassed over.</p>

<p>concepts you struggled with.</p>

<p>frameworks you barely understand but tried to communicate</p>

<p>but. almost nowhere. and no one who does this.</p>

<p>actually and really even maybe remembers who you are.</p>

<p>(and that&rsquo;s the most charitable interpretation)</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t want to own ideas</p>

<p>but i do want my labour and contributions to be recognized.</p>

<p>and yet&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>it's actually something that makes me feel a little crazy. </p><p>am I just engorged on my own hubris? arrogant beyond belief? </p><p>maybe I had nothing to do with this. ppl really do and can think for themselves. I'm not that original of a thinker.</p><p>(but my brain is so attuned to historical patterns of thought and ideas. I can see and know it in the same way I do with much of anything else I talk about. this is,  almost more than anything else,  one of the things my brain does best. I think i've heard that autistics are often good with pattern recognition. intellectual history is my Thing. tracing ideas through time and geography. making connections between ideas. so I know,  deep down, that I'm not wrong. but i could be. right? I'm not important. what I write has no impact. and yet....)</p>
