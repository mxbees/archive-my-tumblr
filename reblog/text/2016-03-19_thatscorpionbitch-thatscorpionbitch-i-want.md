<p>I want to thank everyone again for the donations they sent in earlier this month. Thanks to you, all of my girlfriends’ basic living expenses for the month are covered (rent, bills, and groceries). But we still have moving costs that we need to cover if we want to get them into a new home in a safe, healthy environment. If I could get all of my followers to donate another dollar to dusk_moon@hotmail.com on paypal, it would be enough to cover airfare, hotel, and shipping all of their stuff. </p>
<p>I would also like to ask you to please share their <a href="http://www.transhousingnetwork.com/post/135803610918/need-couch-san-francisco-california">housing post</a>. If we can find someone in San Francisco to help them out, it would make the transition much, much easier on all of us. </p>
<p>Even if you can’t donate, please boost. Hopefully by the end of the month, they can be settled into a new place.</p>

<p>Every little donation makes a huge difference. Please keep sharing.</p>
