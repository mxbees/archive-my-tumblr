<p>my god. trying to work with tumblr’s metadata is so fucking annoying.</p>

<p>as far as i can tell, there’s no consistent way to distinguish between original posts and reblogs in the metadata.</p>

<p>(this is where all the testing is coming from. i finally managed to write a script for downloading all posts from a tumblr… but i’m trying to see if i can filter out reblogs. so far the answer is ‘no’.)</p>

<p>I think to call tumblr coding a hot mess would be generous.</p>

<p>god yes.<br/><br/>like. they srsly can't have one single metadata field to distinguish between original posts and reblogs????<br/><br/>why the fuck....<br/><br/>this is really why if you care about the future archiving of your tumblr, you need to have consistent tagging now. its the only way to organize stuff.</p>
