<p>so. i’ve been playing around with this whole mug cake thing. and yeah, i love it bc it gives me a single sized portion instead of me, um, making an entire batch of cookies and eating them all.</p>

<p>bc texture is kind of a thing with me, here is the recipe for the cake with the most pleasent texture (it tastes good too, btw) according to me:</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

<ul><li>4tbs flour</li>
<li>2tbs brown sugar</li>
<li>2tbs peanut butter</li>
<li>5tbs water</li>
<li>(optional) 1/4tsp baking powder</li>
<li>(optional) a sprinkle of chocolate chips</li>
</ul><p><strong>Directions</strong></p>

<ol><li>Dump all ingredients into mug (order doesn’t matter, I usually put in the dry ingredients then the wet so I don’t have to dry the measuring spoon between).</li>
<li>Mix with great vigour! At least until most of the lumps and such are all gone. Overall, the batter will be thickish.</li>
<li>Microwave for a minute (depending on ur microwave).</li>
<li>Let cool for sufficient time so u don’t burn ur mouth.</li>
<li>Eat!</li>
</ol><p>:D</p>

<p>the other good variation i've had on this is substituting the peanut butter for:<br/><br/>2 tbs of cocoa powder<br/><br/>but only<br/><br/>4 tbs of water</p>
