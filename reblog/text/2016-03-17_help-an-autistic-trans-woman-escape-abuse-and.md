<p>Ok, so thanks to some kind help from <a href="https://tmblr.co/mQ1cxfcq2fduTOMS6HL6Uvw">@mxbees</a> I think I have a working paypal link:</p>

<p>I am a 35-year-old autistic trans woman in the process of escaping an abusive marriage and starting over in the Bay Area with nothing and no support system. My partner destroyed our finances and my credit, and kept me dependent and isolated. <br></p>
<p>Any donations will be used to keep me alive by paying for essential things like food, medications, and housing as I rebuild my life, search for a safe and stable place to live, and hunt for jobs so I can support myself.<br></p>
<p>Even a small donation would mean so much to me. <br></p>
<p>Please help me to stay safe as I escape my abusive relationship.</p>
<p>If you canâ€™t donate, please signal boost if you can. I would be very grateful.<br></p>
