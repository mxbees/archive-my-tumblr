<p>blerg. i think my anxiety is running rampant again. i’ve got the Restlessness.</p>

<p>its weird. its been quite a few months since its been this bad.</p>

<p>debating another ativan or using the Alternative Medicine….</p>

<p>but. since i’m kind of recovering from being sick Smoking seems like it’d be a Terrible Idea.</p>

<p>maybe i’ll flip a coin.</p>

<p>what did the all powerful coin flip determine?</p>

ativan. lol.

which is the wiser decision bc i shouldn't smoke while in recovery.
