<p>I’ve yet to see a post about transitioning that goes into depth about the fucked up process that is name changing as well as how fucked up the process of getting your documents changed is. At least, one that WASN’T written by a trans woman.<br></p>
<p>Like, literally all teh bullshit, instead of “you [can] do this.”</p>
<p>(Here, it costs 200 bucks just for the paperwork and you have to post in the newspaper six weeks or something like that prior to the court hearing, and you better hope the judge doesn’t decide to grant it because Jesus or some bullshit.)<br></p>

<p>Also, other shit no one tells you: it radically changes your job history and who the fuck you can contact. Also, I’m out of the loop as to what you do about your degrees? Do you have to get your name changed on those???? Fuck, no one tells you this shit unless they got the really bad end.<br></p>

ugh. yeah. this is a really big problem.

every so often i think about maybe doing a phd. but then i remember that i'd have to contact my previous professors, tell them my new name and try to explain all of that, hope that they'll still write me a letter of recommendation...

i got the university to change my name on the record... but my degrees are still in my old name.

and yeah. the rest of this. it can take *years* and hundreds of dollars to get this done. 

and when you do?

then you have jump through all the hoops to get bank accounts changed, utilities, etc and so on. the banks are awful bc they have high documentation requirements and usually if you call and ur voice doesn't sound like the 'right' gender they ask you a million more questions than normal and sometimes even outright refuse you access to your own account.

bleh. this is all bullshit.
