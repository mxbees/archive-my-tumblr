<blockquote><p>i know there are some cultural variations and stuff…</p>

<p>but i do have to say that i’m firmly in the ‘no corporal punishment’ camp.</p>

<p>even when/if not abusive, i don’t think hitting kids communicates the right message re: discipline</p></blockquote>

i'm not quite arguing for that super white parenting thing where they try to discuss/debate every single fucking thing with their kids (which i think it horrible in a different way, since child development means that, for example, toddlers aren't capable of the type of moral reasoning i see some white parents expecting from their kids)

but i think it is a lack of imagination that makes a lot of the ppl i see think that you either do corporal punishment OR you do white-hippie-style of parenting. 

however. the awesome parents i do know, the ones who give me hope about the reality and possibility of good parenting do seem to have a good balance between the two. 

i believe that punishment and disciplining children can be accomplished without abuse. it happens. i know it does.
