<p>i think one of the reasons why, after all these years, i still consume as much fiction as i do</p>

<p>(esp. the ~trashy~ genres or fic)</p>

<p>is bc i constantly find the way ppl behave in these books baffling and surprising.</p>

<p>like. do ppl actually act like this? do they behave like this?</p>

<p>i often hear about ‘identifying’ with characters but.</p>

<p>this isn’t really something i do. i can’t imagine myself as pretty much any of these ppl.</p>

<p>i can’t imagine myself having their life bc i just… could not. live. like. that.</p>

<p>can’t imagine myself in about 99% of the situations characters find themselves.</p>

<p>its all so strange.</p>
