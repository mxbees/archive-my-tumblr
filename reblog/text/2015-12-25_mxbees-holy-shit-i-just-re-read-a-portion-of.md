<p>holy shit. i just re-read a portion of the conclusion to my 2015 anthology of essays and…</p>

<p>wow. i’m being <em>ruthless</em>. and i’m sure i’ll have even less friends after this.</p>

<p>i do think i’ll post this section as a distinct blog post though.</p>

<p>bc i think this needs to be said. and i’ve been sitting on this feeling for a while in part bc i know that this will be the moment a lot of ppl i like and respect write me off.</p>

<p>so be it.</p>

<p>especially if my vilification actually results in <em>some</em> change for how teh Discourse is currently being conducted, it’ll be worth it.</p>

<p>its literally been fucking <em>years</em> since that i’ve been holding my tongue about this.</p>

<p>but since 2015 is the year of burning bridges, i think i ought to get this out before the year ends.</p>

<p>i just put it into my queue. so it'll be out later.<br/><br/>my xmas present to everyone is another reason to hate me and excommunicate me from teh Community.</p>
