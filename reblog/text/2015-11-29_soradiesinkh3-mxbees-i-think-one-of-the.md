<p>I think one of the problems of how we talk about abuse,  especially online,  is that the classic models can’t really account for dog piling.</p>

<p>like. one person being harassed by many strangers? they experience a repeated pattern of harm. abuse. </p>

<p>but say it’s a thousand different ppl who only make one nasty comment each. to what extent are they all individually the victim’s abusers? </p>

<p>(this is assuming no coordination or organizing efforts. just a thousand ppl maybe reacting to a single tweet with a horrible comment.  also assuming all else being equal. like one thousand cis white men saying something horrible to another visit white man. not that this is usually the case, but I want to examine the situation without worrying about other factors.) </p>

<p>i just don’t know. bc the person’s subjective experience of abuse is,  I think,  entirely valid. but who is their abuser? I mean. each individual is guilty. but. is it the same as, say,  a lifetime of emotional abuse from a single person? how are these situations different?</p>

<p>I think that we need to differentiate between “an abuser” and “abuse”. Someone doesn’t need a specific abuser for one to have been abused.</p>
<p>(However, assuming everything you postulate is in fact true about a given situation, I see precious few cases where I would describe the above as abuse rather than assholes en masse. I don’t know that we should be differentiating between a lot of individuals deciding to be jerks in a short time and one person being a jerk, but I daresay that it is not as common as we might think for 1000 individual people to randomly decide to dogpile without ANY incentive…such as that person being posted to a blog wherein the purpose is to find groups of people to dogpile.)</p>
<p>I say it as someone who has been dogpiled repeatedly; I consider it generic “online abuse” but if I’m going to bother to think about any individuals, it will be those who set it up/arranged for it, and those people have always existed in my cases.</p>

yes. true.

i mean. in almost every actual case of dogpiling i've ever seen, it's a mass harassment campaign waged against an oppressed person of some kind.

and it is almost always instigated by a few people.

OR

if not instigated, then it is usually a bunch of oppressive assholes made that someone they oppress said a thing.

you're right too, re: being abused does not entail having a singular abuser.

but i think this is part of how we got to the place where we are. that ppl think that if they've been abused, then there must be some identifiable abuser....

which is how i think we get into situations where ppl are accusing a person who interacted with them once or maybe even never directly of abuse.

still just speculating. idk.
