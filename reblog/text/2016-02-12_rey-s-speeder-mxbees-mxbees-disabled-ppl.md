well... to some extent this is partially what i was arguing.

that some ppl, in talking about certain kinds of eugenics, basically assert that there should be restrictions on other ppl's reproductive choices (not just abortion but, say, choosing not to have kids at all bc you don't want a disabled child or whatever).

however. the reason why they get into this perceived moral hardground is because they usually identify the wrong problem.

the issue isn't whether or not individual ppl's reproductive choices are ableist or not

but about a society in which disability is possible at all

(this relies on the social model of disability, such that society disables some people by insufficiently meeting our needs and not properly supporting us)

in a world where any and all disabled people have access to all the support and resources they need (and parents who have disabled children get all the support and resources they need), this issue becomes irrelevant since you can be against other form of eugenics without restricting reproductive freedom.

like. this problem is really only inherent when discussing this kind of eugenics (ie, genetic screening). opposition to other kinds of eugenic tactics like... forced sterilization doesn't entail any restrictions on reproductive freedom.

i hope this helps.
