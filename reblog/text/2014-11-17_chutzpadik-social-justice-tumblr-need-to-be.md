<blockquote>
<p>social justice tumblr need to be really really really careful about conflating ‘has a slightly bigger number of awareness posts here on tumblr dot com’ with ‘actually materially oppresses people with more obscure illnesses’ in re: certain personality disorders.</p>
<p>that kinda bullshit showcases a fundamental misunderstanding of how systems of oppression function, and it’s how we end up with concepts like, uh, ‘bpd privilege’.</p>

<p>oh, hey.<br/><br/>This was exactly what I was talking about when I said that trans women of colour get a lot of lip service when it comes to centering us on the internet...<br/><br/>But how this rarely ever translates to offline. <br/><br/>Where you'll get dfab agender ppl<br/><br/>\*cough\*youneedacat\*cough\*<br/><br/>talking about how trans women of colour take up too much conceptual space when it comes to talking about gender-based oppression. </p>
