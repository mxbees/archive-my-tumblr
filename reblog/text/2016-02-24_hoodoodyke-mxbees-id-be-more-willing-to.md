<p>I’d be more willing to engage in ace discourse if so many of them didn’t joyfully engage in so much horizontal aggression. </p>

<p>like. I want nothing to do with u ppl. </p>

<p>ur embarrassing. </p>

<p>this is why I dont generally bother to ID myself as ace. I don’t want ppl thinking I’m with u. bc i’m really not. </p>

<p>I don’t like u. u aren’t in my community. if only bc i’ve learned that I have no community. but mainly bc I’d rather be by myself than claim u.</p>

<p>What do you mean by horizontal aggression? You mean lgbt ace VS lgbt ace or like ace VS ace or?</p>
</blockquote>

more like... lgbt ace vs gay. or whatever. like when aces are openly homophobic. 

horizontal aggression isn't my term and i'm not 100% committed to it bc i think it flattens actual hierarchies of oppression (or has been used this way anyway)
