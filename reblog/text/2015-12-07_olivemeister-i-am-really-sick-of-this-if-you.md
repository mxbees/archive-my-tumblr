<p>i am really sick of this “if you don’t disclose all these private things about you to every stranger on the internet, you must be cis, white, straight, able-bodied, <i>and </i>mentally healthy” mentality that tumblr has.</p>
<p>it’s like… despite what so many of us are working to subvert (sometimes the same people making assumptions, absurdly enough), you still have this mental image of that as the default state of humanity. and unless we state that we deviate from this false “norm”, it’s assumed that we fall under it.</p>
<p>and it’s making it so that people are forced into oversharing and oversharing becomes normal. you don’t have any right to know these things unless i really, truly am comfortable with/want to share them. not everyone is comfortable with disclosing the private details of their lives, and you seeing that desire for privacy, making assumptions, and attacking them is fucked up.</p>
<p>you wouldn’t expect someone you met at school to tell you all these things. you wouldn’t expect your sister’s boyfriend to tell you all these things. you don’t have a right to that knowledge, and being on the internet doesn’t change it.</p>

i was trying so hard to scroll by...

but. i feel a certain way about someone who appears white (or, at least, is as light skinned as i am) putting race into this list. also ability. maybe gender.

the reality is that a lot of these things are visible and apparent. as much as i'd like to say that strangers don't have a right to know my gender, race, whatever. most of the time? they can tell by looking. i don't have to disclose certain aspects of myself to strangers bc they know.

while the internet can be nice as a way to... render invisible what is visible offline... this post fails to take into account how the assumption that unmarked ppl on the internet are the default human is, at least amongst the ppl i know, a self-defense mechanism.

bc it isn't about *our* assumptions. the fact is that a lot of people who fit whatever default we are talking about think they are the default, thus, they can leave their race, ability,gender, unmarked. 

to a large extent, i agree with the above. but it also isn't enough. on more than one occassion i (and other poc) have said that white ppl should *always* declare their race. i don't really care if anyone else does, but i do expect white ppl to. why? bc leaving their race unmarked perpetuates the notion that they are the default human.
