<p>If you’re as continually ridiculing of my body as you are when I go to something dressed as I tend to dress and present every day as part of daily survival, in other words soft ghetto-professional butch, are you not limiting my ability to present however I want?</p>
<p>After all, y’all have, repeatedly, made it very plain that a cornerstone of White Trans Woman Discourse is ridiculing “defective” bodies. And I’m all the shit you hate: fat, ugly, disabled, not white, not the white-”exotic” kind of PoC (the ones with european-lookin’ features and dark but not too dark skin*), and my body doesn’t go to a white trans woman approved tech job or elitist bullshit liberal arts college. </p>
<p>So it begs the question: if you’re this consistently douchey about my body (and other shit like my name, my being visibly mentally disabled, etc.) in jeans and a hoodie, how fucking merciless would y’all be about me in a dress?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thought so.</p>
<p>Thanks again for being the boot on my neck, you shitty violent ofays. Keep leading us to ongoing failure so you can be the center of attention and the queen of your own compost heap, and remember the defective must be kept out at all costs…as y’all mysteriously welcome in nazis and rapists if they’re skinny and white. What are you saying in the constant thrum that being fat and ugly is worse than being a rapist?</p>
<p>* = this seems to be void for Asian trans women, as basically white trans women either fetishize Asian trans women or are interminably shitty to them. But not being Asian, I can’t tell you how it is, but being a person with a pulse, a modicum of compassion, and a few working brain cells, I can tell you that’s fucked up. </p>

gah. re: your footnote. i have a lot of Feelings about how white trans women deal with (primarily SE) asian trans women. 

and... yeah. i'm being specific about this bc when ppl tend to think about trans asian women they think of the ladyboys of thailand, malaysia, the philippines, etc (in part bc those areas have a lot of beauty pageants and are otherwise hypervisible in popular media).

maybe sometime i'll write about this. but. yeah. its definitely fucked up.
