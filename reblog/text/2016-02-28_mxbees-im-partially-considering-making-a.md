<p>i’m partially considering making a website for the 2nd edition of decolonizing trans/gender 101.</p>

<p>like. still write the book. but… now that i’m recording some of the sections.</p>

<p>it’d be interesting to collect it all into one, centralized place….</p>

<p>like the videos. transcripts. actual chapters or sections. organized and basically viewable.</p>

<p>and then ppl could like, pay for downloads of the video and a full copy of the book.</p>

<p>but otherwise everything would be up there and freely accessible…</p>

but i can't decide if this should be off or on tumblr. 

tumblr would be easy enough and def. make multimedia stuff much, much simpler.

idk. idk.
