clicking on the OP shows that they are probably white and not a trans woman of colour

so....

let's talk about the erasure of _who_ exactly is dying from trans_misogynist_ violence?

especially since her original tags include #tdor2014

so....

how do you make a tdor post and _not_ recognize that it is __trans women of colour__ who are dying???

(globally: the list is half Brazillian twoc which most likely means: mostly Black Latina trans women........)

it isn't trans ~people~

who need to be protected

but 

trans _women of colour_.

fucking get it right asshole
