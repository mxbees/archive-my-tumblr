<p>So…. <a href="http://syx.pw/21K0vx9">I just wrote this post about rethinking community</a>. And in writing the post I came to an uncomfortable realization. Something I’m not particularly happy about but need to face head on anyway.</p>

<p>One of the main things in that post was about how contemporary ideological movements/communities tend to disavow structure, which just ends up in the leaders of the community not being formally recognized, rather than there being no leaders at all. And without the formal recognition of leadership, it becomes very very easy to dodge accountability for what you do as a leader.</p>

<p>If I can recognize that <a href="http://syx.pw/1P0Ogbi">activism has a reputational economy</a> and that reputation is connected to prestige. Prestige: “the sharing of expertise or know-how to gain respect” is connected to social status: “social rank, which we conceptualized as the acquisition of (a) perceived influence over others (Study 1), (b) actual influence over others’ behaviors (Study 1), and © others visual attention”<sup id="fnref:p140394777369-cheng"><a href="#fn:p140394777369-cheng" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>If I can recognize this, then I also need to be more honest about my social rank and/or social status. As much as I can disavow communities ties and claim that I’m not a part of any of them, this doesn’t really make a difference for how other people perceive my influence within the types of communities that I regularly talk about. Its sort of a trap of identity-based communities. While I do nothing active to participate in teh ~trans community~, this doesn’t change the fact that most people will consider me to be a member of it – regardless of my direct involvement. Who I am determines my membership, not what I do.</p>

<p>As such, regardless of my intention or desires, I do have some kind of social rank within teh ~trans community~ (amongst others). As a result, people either perceive me as being influential or, in reality, I am influential. If I want to be honest, I have to recognize that both things are true. People do perceive me as influential and I am, in actuality, influential.</p>

<p>And this influence isn’t about how many followers I have, since I don’t have that many relative to other ‘leaders’<sup id="fnref:p140394777369-gag"><a href="#fn:p140394777369-gag" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. But I cannot deny (and neither do others) that my ideas are influential and they spread far and wide. I mean… I’ve noted how certain concepts and frameworks that I’m well-known for have been showing up in places – without credit or citation. That people who don’t even like me use some of my ideas within their theorizing.</p>

<p>Despite my… internal disgust with conceptualizing myself as a ‘leader’ (most likely a ‘thought leader’?), it is (and has been) disingenuous for me to deny this reality.</p>

<p>This unwillingness to recognize and accept this reality has also meant that I haven’t been accountable in the ways that ‘leaders’ ought to be accountable. What I write has consequences that reach much farther than I’ve been willing to acknowledge. Some of these consequences are good. But some are bad.</p>

<p>Either way… I need to make myself more open and accountable and responsive to criticism. Leaders, formally recognized or not, are accountable to their communities. We should be. We are.</p>

<p>God. I know I’m really onto something important here because I cannot express how deeply uncomfortable writing all of this is for me. So much of me wants to… abstract this problem and distance it from myself. Which of course is exactly the problem.</p>

<p>I’m not quite sure how to move forward with this new realization. I think the first step, for me, is that – regardless of how tedious and annoying I find it – I need to begin responding to criticism I see of my ideas and posts. Responding in good faith, even if they critiques aren’t in good faith. Additionally… I do think it’ll be imperative for me, going forward, to be much more open to explaining myself.</p>

<p>In general, people should expect to see me engage with people in a very different way than I’ve been doing for the past few years.</p>

<p>As a sidenote: I’m not talking just about accountability in the sense of me doing harmful things (ie, callouts). I’ve already mentioned that I don’t intend on defending myself against any of these types of things. But there is more to accountability than just performing contrition. One of the things I personally think that matters for accountable leadership is transparency. And this is definitely one area that I’ve been dodging. There are others. I’ll keep thinking on this problem and figuring out a way to navigate it.</p>

<p>In any case, its time for me to stop pretending like this isn’t a real thing. Because it is. And my accountability dodging has been contributing to the exact kind of community dynamics that I’ve been criticizing.</p>

<p>I can’t tell you how much it chokes me to think of myself as a leader within teh ~trans community~. This is not something I want to be thought of. And I have a lot of problems with it, but I really need to get the fuck over it. <a href="#fnref:p140394777369-gag" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>

<p>Huh, this is really interesting. There’s some stuff here that I can relate to, but more in the sense that I came to terms with it a while ago, and what I’ve found helpful is to keep things SUPER concrete, not making generalizations, and trying to demonstrate interpersonal dynamics rather than explain them. And to keep this concrete, I’m talking about the realization that what you say influences other people regardless of your intent.<br></p>

<p>For me it was a commitment to being fairly uncomfortable literally forever. And actually, some of it came down to *not* engaging certain kinds of criticism, rather than engaging it more. Because really, sometimes it’s more about ego and/or trying to micromanage how you’re perceived, rather than actually being positively engaged with anything. Think of it like, you know how some writers will get in flame wars about their own books on goodreads comments? ;) It’s never cute.</p>

<p>For me, it’s always been about taking my time to REALLY process something, rather than just reacting. If I fail to do that, I’ve failed, period. <br></p>

<p>i try to keep things concrete… but my brain totally tends towards discussing stuff at a meta level which is always an abstraction of some kind.</p>

<p>which is fine. its my style and how i do things. but i def. think this leaves me open to certain kinds of critiques that being more concrete doesn’t.</p>

<p>i can see what you’re saying about engagement… the way i was understanding what i wrote was a desire to simply be more transparent. as in… give people greater context for clarity. explain things the confuse people. etc. not so much defending myself and my writing. i don’t think that is what i need to do.</p>

<p>although, what you say here makes me realize that i should stick to responding to stuff expressed in good faith. it’ll prevent me, i think, from getting into situations where i’m just trying to defend myself and my reputation.</p>

<p>also… this is also about getting my brain oriented towards being more open to criticism and not dodging this kind of accountability.</p>

<p>Oh, I’ll always bow to your expertise when it comes to meta level and theory. We’re two people with very opposite ways of thinking, which I think is pretty cool actually. <br></p>

<p>For me the way I orient myself to the same issue (acknowledging influence) is going to be a somewhat larger representation of <i>my</i> own neverending personal crisis, which is the inability to really know if people are understanding what I’m saying, being unable to control how it’s interpreted by others, and if communication is really happening/being effective. <br></p>

<p>I’m just giving my two cents in that I think you could be a little kinder to yourself than you are above, while still being accountable and acknowledging your responsibility. While at the same time considering that impostor syndrome is A Thing, especially when what you say carries weight AND you’ve had a lot of backlash because of it. <br></p>

<p>ok ngl but this seems a lot more like a negative result of hypervisibility. not a bonus. the perception of being a leader or influential basically ALWAYS nets to absolutely nothing in the way of any real bonus or privilege. what it does do is force you to uphold a contract that you never signed…while leaving your life with a net effect in the negative.<br><br>perceived anything with no actual benefit for you is meaningless and not comparable to those with actual influence.<br><br>case in point: certain idiotic comments about being jedi mind trick’d into being mean to others by someone who has no idea who the fuck you are but simply *perceives* themselves as having been jedi mind trick’d.</p>

hrm. 

given that in a lot of cases i do tend to accept my friends's opinions on matters like this...

i've heard from like three or four ppl so far that i'm being a little hard on myself. 

and... yeah i'm totally still processing this and figuring out the... nuances? details? bc ur right about that. 

for me, i guess the key is trying to balance out the fact that i don't exist in isolation and that what i say does have some kind of impact (regardless of size) with the reality that some ppl are absolutely hypervisible targets for things like smear campaigns and mass harassment. 

tala and i also explored some of the faults and limitations with what i expressed above, esp. in terms of how certain people are also expected to do more kinds of labour and/or held to higher standards than others. my example was Laverne Cox. like... she's clearly influential and a leader but i know that i get frustrated with people who expect her to be a Perfect Advocate who is super informed about all aspects of the discourse. but. like. she's an *actor*. as tala mentioned, cis white gay celebs aren't held to this same standard.

and i def. do not want to go so far into this that i end up saying that any of us should be held responsible for what other people do. how another person choses to act on my ideas or words isn't my responsiblity, esp. bc i'm quite clearly not engaging in hate speech (whose purpose is to incite violence).

thank you both for your thoughts on this. its really helpful and super valuable.

also, as i vaguely metioned before, i'd like to thank you both specifically for your friendship. more than a lot of other things, you've both helped me stay honest with myself and grounded. (the above is a great example of this)

so... thank you both. your friendship means the world to me.
