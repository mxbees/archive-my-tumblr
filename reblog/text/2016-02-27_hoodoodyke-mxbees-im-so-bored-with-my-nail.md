<p>Iâ€™m so bored with my nail polish colours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What colors would you like to have?</p>

idek anymore.

like. i use gel polish and.... i have all the colours i like from the brand i usually buy. so i'm like... what do.

in general, i think i'm just... 'meh' about my nails. for now it seems like growing them out isn't really an option. which i actually don't mind having them short, tbh.

but....
