<p>i’m starting to have some… interesting ideas about baybayin and the ways i see a lot of filipinxs talking about it.</p>

maybe someday i'll finally publish a post about my feelings on ethnicity, race, indigeneity, and how they all intersect re: filipinxs.

(i think i've written this post about five times already, they are all sitting in my drafts bc i haven't been able to quite articulate what i want to say about it all)
