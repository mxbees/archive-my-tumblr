<p>actually, on second thought, what i read was worse,</p>

<p>despite being written by Authentic Gay Men™.</p>

<p>what i read set me up with the expectation that i’d get out of school.</p>

<p>and fall into the welcoming arms of the Gay Community Inc.</p>

<p>at least with these mm books there is about zero implication</p>

<p>that a gay community exists at all.</p>

<p>which is… strangely, closer to reality than the books i read.</p>

<p>omggg, this though.  All the books I read and movies I watched had the message that once you were out the community would be there for you.  That it was basically a family with open arms.  And lmao was that ever wrong.</p>

<p>Like, all the novels about gay kids in high school or the movies about it, they’re all friends, and they all have an older mentor who’s kind and patient and like…that’s the literal opposite of what things are like.</p>

yeah. at least these mm books don't really tell the lie that there is some community out there for you since pretty much none of them have any meaningful engagement with the Gay Community Inc.

and in their own way... they are more honest, given that if you aren't white, masc, and fit, you pretty much do not exist in Gay Community Inc.
