<p>i’ve decided that my book review videos will be of two kinds:</p>

<ol><li>i’ll review individual books</li>
<li>i’ll discuss tropes in mm</li>
</ol><p>my brain just… moves towards generalities and abstractions. so… i’m not going to fight it.</p>

<p>ok. but i’m going to try recording something nao!</p>

ok. i just recorded two videos.

one is a review of a book and the other is basically me talking about how gross mm kissing is and laughing for five minutes.

i intend for the review to come out first, but do ppl have any strong preference one way or another?
