<p>this is mostly for fun. not sure if this is something i’ll keep up with.</p>

<p>today’s book is <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6909649-love-means-no-shame"><em>love means… no shame</em></a> by andrew grey.</p>

<p>the plot of this book is, in a sentence, a story of a cowboy and amish man falling in love.</p>

<p>the main conflict of the story is that the amish man is on a year away trying to decide if he wants to be baptised or not. so the MC falls in love with him and spends a large portion of the book worrying that he’ll leave at the end of the year.</p>

<p>its the source of a lot of angst.</p>

<p>this wouldn’t be puzzling, if not for the 9 million times the MC says, “i’m worried that he’s going to leave, but i can’t tell him that” or something to that effect. like here is a reconstructed scene:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jeff went quiet thinking that Eli might choose to go back to his family at the end of the year.</p>
  
  <p>“is everything ok?” eli asks.</p>
  
  <p>jeff knows he shouldn’t tell eli about his worries, because he needs to make his own decisions, so he smiles and says, ‘yes’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>variations of this scene happen like five fucking times. and each time all i can think of is “why. why can’t u tell him that you want him to stay.”</p>

<p>i. don’t. get. it.</p>

<p>i get that miscommunication is like… a primary plot device for most romance/fic writers. i even get why, since it is an easy way to build tension.</p>

<p>what i don’t get is the reasoning always provided for it.</p>

<p>towards the end, the MC is like “i would never make eli choose between me and his family and this is why i can’t tell him that i want him to stay.”</p>

<p>what the fuck do these two things have to do with each other??????</p>

<p>is this how normal ppl actually think?</p>

honest to glob, if this *is* how normal ppl think, i have a much better understanding of why i was such a massive failure at dating.
