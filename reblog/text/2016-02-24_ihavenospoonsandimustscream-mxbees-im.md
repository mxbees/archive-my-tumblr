<p>If you were the type to keep whiskey, I’d suggest making a hot toddy, made with some honey, lemon, and spice tea (and whiskey of course). It won’t cure it, but it’ll help with the sore throat. It’ll still work without the alcoholc, but the main purpose of the whiskey is to numb the throat anyways.</p></blockquote>

<p>huh. I might try it. </p><p>I think we have bourbon....</p>
