<p>honestly watching white trans people get visibility and jobs is fantastic and all. but it really, really stings seeing that the world isn’t ready for accepting  trans people of color like that yet.</p>

<p>like, transness is attractive and acceptable, glamorous even, until it’s associated with a brown body. and that really hurts to see that and be ‘pushed down the list,’ and also to see the stark, starker-than-ever contrast between white trans women and trans women of color.</p>

<p>it’s an extremely polarizing time in terms of race and gender and that really upsets me because i see progress, but i dont see it happening in the right ways if that makes any sense.</p>

<p>if i were an asshole...<br/><br/>i'd also point out how the most successful twoc i know<br/><br/>happen to look like me (very light skinned and/or white passing).<br/><br/>but i'd only say this if i were an asshole.<br/><br/>since i'm not, i'll just nod and reblog.</p>
