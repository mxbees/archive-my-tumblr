Luna had a great post, once upon a time, talking about this (although they were more talking about cis ppl claiming trans ppl as 'family')

but i still think that it is relevant.

like. yeah. sisterhood _is_ powerful. 

but most of the trans women i've met/encountered... 

they end up being opponents, not family. 

you don't get to call me 'sister' if u think i'm subhuman garbage
