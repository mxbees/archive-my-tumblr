i saw another set of advice that is useful... but only if you really *know* that you have anxiety, depression, etc. while i was in school the only thing i was sure of was that i did get depressed several times. also ptsd. *none* of this was formally diagnosed. however, during this time i was also, unbeknownst to me, dealing with anxiety and being autistic.

what this means, is that the entire time i was in school it never, ever even ocurred to me to try and seek accommodation.

and i did manage to get through one bachelors and two masters.

i also had to work part-time bc i had no support from my parents.

anyway. here's how i managed:

(one warning before i get into this, none of this is especially designed to get you through unscathed, since i certainly didn't. but i got through. that may or may not be enough for you.)

**never take a full course load**

like. ever. i don't think i ever once took the standard five classes a semester. i usually was between three and four. to compensate, i did summer classes (but it still took me longer to finish). i found doing school yearround helped me maintain a routine of studying.

**work as little as you can get away with**

not sure if you have to work... but let me tell you a story about how i learned not to push myself too hard... i think in my second semester, i was in four classes and working two jobs. total hours of work a week: 35. i think i lasted until november when i had a complete psychotic break (not that i knew this at the time). and so i learned that i really couldn't (if i wanted to survive) work more than about twenty hours a week. even if it meant i was desperately poor all the time and had no money to do anything ever.

**decide what matters**

so. for most ppl's lives in school, there are about three elements that tend to be considered The College Experience. School itself, socializing, (and for me work, the third thing might be dif. for you). I quickly learned that i could only do two of those things. and so... i began my long slide into being a hermit. i sacrificed my social life so i could try and get decent grades. bc that mattered to me at that point.

however, depending on what you are doing in school and why you are there, remember the old saying "even C's get degrees". if ur not thinking about grad school or any such continuation of your studies, then.... stop worrying about getting perfect (or even the best possible grades). figure out what's good enough for you and how much effort that takes. and then do that and that alone. if u don't need A's (or a 4.0 or whatever), don't put in A-level effort. it'll free up some of your time and mental space to do other things. after you graduate, pretty much no one gives a fuck about what your GPA was in school. 

**time. oh time**

related to above... time. figuring out what you *need* to do vs. what would be ideal is important for allocating time. bc of things related to executive dysfunction, depression related lack of motivation, etc and so on, i knew that i had to give myself a shitfuckton of time to get assignments and papers finished. like. if i wanted to get one hour of solid studying done, i need to schedule like three hours for studying.

(this is why i couldn't have a social life in school. studying or working took up all of my time)

in practise, what this meant is that i literally started term papers or any other assignments i knew about in advance the *day they were assigned*. like. started look for books. thinking about my thesis. and so on. i had no other choice if i wanted to finish on time (in part bc i was a very slow, very bad writer and i need LOTS of time to edit otherwise i did horrifically on my papers).

don't get me wrong, procrastination, exec dysfunction, lack of motivation, etc all ate into the available time and spoons i had for studying. but what starting (even if just doing searches on the library website to get an idea about a topic) right away did was mean that if, two weeks down the road, i had an entire week where i could just not get my shit together to study, it rarely put me behind.

**don't read all the readings**

bc of autism... i didn't actually know or realize until my fourth year that pretty much NO ONE reads all the assinged readings. so don't bother. 

**lean on your strengths**

note above i mentioned that i'm a slow, bad writer? thus, i gave myself more time for this (actually i allocated the majority of my time to research and writing). i personally could do this bc remembering everything i read is one of my major academic strengths. this meant that if i did keep up with my readings throughout the semester, i almost never had to study before exams.

you might be the opposite. maybe you write well, easily, and fast. you could be the type that can write a paper the night before and get a high grade. whatever. i'm sure there is *something* you are good at. so figure out what that is and learn how to apply it to give yourself more time for the things you aren't so great at. 

for example, if you are the 'last minute A paper' type, stop worrying about doing your papers at any other time. stop wasting emotional energy and stress thinking that you should be doing it. just literally tell urself that you'll do it the night before. so you can focus on other things. 

one fringe benefit of doing it this way means is that by spending more time on the things you're bad at, you eventually *get better at them*. this usually means that after a few years of doing this, maybe you aren't such a bad writer anymore (or you still suck but you can write faster, which is me).

er... that's enough for now. good luck.
