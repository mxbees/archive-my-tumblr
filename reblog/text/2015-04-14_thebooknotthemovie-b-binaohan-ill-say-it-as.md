<p>Not even a little bit. </p>

<p>So be careful when trying to talk about “people with penises” as if cis men and trans women with penises EVER share some common privilege. </p>

<p>Now _that_ is classic transmisogyny.</p></blockquote>
The only privilege is peeing standing up, I am jealous of that.</blockquote>

<p>This is like the fifth time someone has left this fucking comment and it is so fucking annoying.</p><p>I get it. You're fucking super clever and so fucking funny. Ha. Ha.</p><p>This despite the fact that peeing standing up can cause dysphoria for some trans women.</p><p>This despite the fact that some of us who don't mind peeing standing up get policed by other trans women for being fake.</p><p>Or that peeing standing up in a public washroom could lead to violence.</p><p>But. Ha! Make a fucking clever joke about what trans women do in the washroom like this isn't a constant source of anxiety and violence.</p>
