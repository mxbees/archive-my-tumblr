<p>although. the delay in satisfying my impulse</p>

<p>has made me realize that i could probably do the shaved head + bangs look</p>

<p>(a chelsea?)</p>

<p>best of both worlds. since i only code as cis if my hair is in my face.</p>

<p>but then i can be low maintenance otherwise.</p>

<p>so this isn’t going to happen.<br><br>not when this cut is so closely tied to skinhead culture.<br><br>i mean. i’ve had friends who’ve done this without knowing the history. but now that i know, i cant unknow and i refuse to sport a style that could remotely identify me as a skinhead.<br><br>refuse.<br><br>i’d rather be misgendered 24/7.</p>

<p>what if you do an undercut? Or shave on all sides except the top. I never knew about the chelsea, but a lot black women do that</p>

yeah! i'm googling various styles and seeing a bunch of other ones i can do.

it looks like the chelsea really is all shaved except bangs with two longer pieces on each side (or just bangs).

i'm thinking of aiming for something like this:

since both are great and sort of what i want

(mostly short and easy to maintain but still femme)
