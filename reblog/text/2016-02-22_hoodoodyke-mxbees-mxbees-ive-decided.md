<p>i’ve decided that my book review videos will be of two kinds:</p>

<ol><li>i’ll review individual books</li>
<li>i’ll discuss tropes in mm</li>
</ol><p>my brain just… moves towards generalities and abstractions. so… i’m not going to fight it.</p>

<p>ok. but i’m going to try recording something nao!</p>

<p>ok. i just recorded two videos.</p>

<p>one is a review of a book and the other is basically me talking about how gross mm kissing is and laughing for five minutes.</p>

<p>i intend for the review to come out first, but do ppl have any strong preference one way or another?</p>

<p>I wanna hear five minutes of laughter</p>

i laugh a lot in the 'first' one too.

just. um. not quite as much.

but. yeah... i figured ppl would like that one more. 

so i'll start Big. 

(need to finish transcribing and captioning though)
