<p><a href="http://bigbardafree.tumblr.com/post/96054724187/the-thing-about-being-someone-whos-never" class="tumblr_blog">bigbardafree</a>:</p><blockquote><p>the thing about being someone who’s never catcalled is that you start to wonder why like is it because im ugly???</p><p>and then you realize that youre judging your worth by whether or not you are objectifiable to a man and thats so fucked up like honestly its so fucked up </p>
<p>but the worst part about the patriarchy is that it still sits at the back of your mind regardless like “nobody thinks youre pretty because they dont see you as a sex object” like somehow thats a desirable thing and it fucks me up</p></blockquote>

<p>and if ur a trans woman u get the fun, fucked up experience of getting catcalled/street harassed and maybe feeling like u've accomplished something bc, for once, u passed well enough to be subjected to this really commonplace (but violent) form of misogyny...<br/><br/>then ur like... this is fucked up bc i'm basing my 'success' as a woman based on whether or not some random fucking guy decides to be sexist shithead</p>
