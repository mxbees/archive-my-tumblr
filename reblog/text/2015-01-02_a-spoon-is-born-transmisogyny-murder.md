<p>ah. wow.</p>
<p>and here u have it.</p>
<p>and, unless we forget, <em>who</em> is being murdered in the US?</p>

<p>Yep. The only state to make it illegal to ‘justify’ <a href="http://www.advocate.com/crime/2014/09/29/california-becomes-first-state-ban-gay-trans-panic-defenses">murdering trans women over your disgust at “discovering” they are trans is California, and that was literally three months ago.</a></p>

<p>Almost every article you’ll find about <a href="http://roygbiv.jezebel.com/gay-or-trans-panic-defenses-are-crap-and-now-illegal-in-1641055202">it ignores the race of the victims</a>, including the one whose murder drew attention to this “defense”, <a href="http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=68114">Gwen Araujo</a>.</p></blockquote>
