<p>i actually have some ideas about this. they're bubbling in my mind and i'll probably write something soon.<br/><br/>something to do with activism(tm) being a reputational economy. and how maybe, just maybe, if we actually valued the labour that went into it, people might not have to perform purity in order to make a living and be an activist....</p>
