<p>re: someone’s comment about gravity falls and anti-Blackness… YES. sooo many problems.</p>

<p>also… i can’t decide if one of mabel’s friends is transmisogynist or not.</p>

<p>bc i’m pretty sure that the ‘punchline’ with that friend is that she’s a girl with a deep, raspy voice and it really fucking gets to me.</p>

<p>I’ve always been made uncomfortable by that. She always struck me as more masculine on purpose, and I was always unsure if she was meant to be a butt of some joke I wasn’t getting.</p>

yeah. i can't quite figure it out myself. 

i mean... in a recent episode, they make a point of commenting on her voice and not in a 'nice' way. 

i was sort of on the fence until that point

now? i'm def. thinking its a running transmisogynist joke.

different than tina on bob's burgers (which has its own set of problems). as far as i know (but i haven't seen too many of the episodes), no one really comments on her voice despite it not being very cis-normative for 'girls'.
