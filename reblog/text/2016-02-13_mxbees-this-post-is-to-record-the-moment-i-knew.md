<blockquote><p>this post is to record the moment i knew that my career was Officially Dead.</p>

<p>the story starts with this <a href="http://syx.pw/1QyiIGc">job posting for a Digital Projects Librarian</a>. i applied for this job. i didn&rsquo;t get an interview. fuck, i didn&rsquo;t even get an email acknowledging that i&rsquo;d applied at all. as far as i know, i tossed my resume into the void (or, more likely, this is what they did).</p>

<p>i told myself when i applied, &lsquo;if i don&rsquo;t even get an interview, i&rsquo;ll know for sure that i&rsquo;m as unemployable as i&rsquo;ve been saying&rsquo; and behold!</p>

<p>i am unemployable in my field.</p>

<p>you might ask yourself (if you bothered to read the job ad) why this was the Definitive Test for me.</p>

<p>why?</p>

<p>as it happens 'digital projects librarian&rsquo; is my current job title. just part-time. i have all of the qualifications. and 95% of the preferred qualifications are my actual job. like. literally what i do when i&rsquo;m at work. the other stuff? like the last one? i&rsquo;ve been teaching myself ruby for the past few years. and so on.</p>

<p>i applied using, as a foundation, the exact cover letter that bagged me an interview the last time i applied for a job with U of T.</p>

<p>no response.</p>

<p>normally, when i haven&rsquo;t got a position, it usually goes to someone with more experience or better suited experience. for this job? lol. no. you know who got the job? somone who literally graduated <em>last year</em> and this is their first professional job. compared to me, someone whose been in the field for four years and meets all the qualifications.</p>

<p>so here&rsquo;s my recipe for becoming unemployable:</p>

<p>step 1: be a poor, disabled, trans pinay<br/>
step 2: destroy your reputation by taking an ethical stance in a field dominated by Nice White Ladies&trade;</p>

<p>viola. one dead career.</p>

<p>anyway. this is reminding me that the mcdonald&rsquo;s down the street is hiring and i should apply.</p></blockquote>

<p>honest to God. I wish I'd never looked up who got this job instead of me. </p><p>knowing it went to a recent graduate with no professional experience is so fucking depressing. </p><p>they didn't even acknowledgey application. I'm guessing they just tossed it in the garbage and moved on. </p><p>I think this has firmly stomped on any tiny residual feelings that maybe I could salvage something from this mess. </p><p>it's over. I spent two years getting a degree. like four years looking for full time work,  working in the field, contributing uncompensated labour (my research, conference presentations, other writing). </p><p>all wasted bc we live in a shitty fucking world.</p>
