- we consume a lot of rice
- maybe about 4kg at a minimum a month
- so we buy huge bags bc they're cheaper per kilo

<p>i was very surprised to learn that parboiled rice has about 80% of the nutrients of brown rice.</p>

<p>i used to make fun of it bc its what i know as ‘white ppl rice’ but i’ve been buying it bc its cheaper than jasmine, basmati, brown, and other kinds of rice (usually one of the cheapest – like an 8kg bag for $7 or something like that).</p>

<p>anyway. parboiled rice is a good way to increase the nutritional value of your rice and it reduces costs. it also isn’t… as texturally unpleasant as brown rice (it actually has, for me, a pleasant chewiness).</p>

<p>just… fyi.</p>

<p>I’m very passionate about rice. I’ll rant about rice at the drop of a hat. Actually, you know it’s kinda funny but right around when Bf had his surgery and I got laid off and it was like REALLY bad, a friend of mine offered to buy us food because she knew we couldn’t afford it. and one of the things I was firm on was Bag of Rice must be this particular KIND and SIZE, because as long as there’s<i> rice </i>there’s <i>food</i>, you know? But yeah maybe I’ll try this for the rice i make with my greens. I usually use jasmine rice for it but who knows this might be good.<br></p>

i'm pretty pationate about rice too. i mean... rice is my Sacred Food as a filipino. 

but yeah. jasmine is really the bestest. but i do like other varieties.

parboiled rice is that rice you get in white people restaurants. it isn't very sticky and the grains are really distinct, like basmati. and i do like the chewiness it has. 

of course. there is always the autism and other sensory things to consider. so if you do try it, i'd recommend getting a small bag first (even if overall less economical).

but yeah... know that i know it has greater nutritional content than most white rices and that its consistently cheaper? it'll probably become the main kind of rice i eat. with jasmine and the others as a special treat once in a while.
