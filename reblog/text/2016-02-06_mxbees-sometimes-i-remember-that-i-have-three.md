<p>sometimes i remember that i have three degrees</p>

<p>like. four years of job experience in my field.</p>

<p>and yet</p>

<p>like. every month or two, i’m begging for money bc i’m so poor i can’t afford my meds. i can barely afford to feed myself.</p>

<p>lololol.</p>

i'm a great example of what happens to undiagnosed disabled ppl who push themselves into trying to keep up bc they don't know any better.

everything is hard all the time and u think this is all there is to life. 

u do all the Right Things

suddenly ur 32 years old.

and u can't get a full time job

u have to supplement ur income by begging for money on the internet

everything is still hard all the time

(but at least now you know why)

all your dreams are dead.

and you have no more will to dream anymore.
