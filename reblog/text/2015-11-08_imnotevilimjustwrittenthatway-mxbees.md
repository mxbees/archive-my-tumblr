<p>I have a huge problem with the idea that there is no prediscursive moment for so many different reasons.</p>
<p>It’s actually absurdly essentialist (Discourse has been all, is all, will be all) and tautological.<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>honestly? it is also a type of linguistic determinism which. yeah. i don’t agree with.<br><br>sure sure. ppl like to pretend ‘discourse’ isn’t just language, but this how it frames itself nonetheless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s exactly what I meant with “it reminds me of Chomsky” since he is a big linguistic determinism proponent, at least with regards to the origin of language, lol. <br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>what does ‘prediscursive’ mean in this sense?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s close, but not exactly, the same thing as “pre-language.” It also means “pre-culture,” kind of (because discourse can’t exist without either, and both sort of implicate each other, since language is a big way culture gets transmitted).</p>
<p>I hope this made sense and wasn’t a garbage explanation.<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that does make sense.</p>
<p>And also, I am curious as to what ‘no prediscursive moment existed’ would even mean. That humans sprung fully formed into existence and discourse at some point? How would that work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>honestly? the way i view this is that it is an epistemological claim.</p>

<p>essentially that even <em>if</em> stuff existed before discourse, whatever that is, is unknowable bc we can only interface with the world with discourse.</p>

<p>as in, discourse is a necessary condition for knowledge of the world.</p>

<p>so like. the claim is less that no objects existed prior to discourse but, more or less, that nothing is or can be known about these objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I see. so the claim that ‘there’s no prediscursive moment’ is self-defeating, like saying ‘there was no pre-patriarchy’. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>yeah. pretty much.<br/><br/>although this discussion is making me realize that this position is a type of idealism, such that we can only ever know discursive constructs and nothing about the external world.<br/><br/>huh. </p>
