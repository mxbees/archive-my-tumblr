<p>also curious if any of the asians claiming that Black ppl are silencing us or erasing us or whatever the fuck</p>

<p>are going to give Viola Davis any credit.</p>

<p>literally every single time i’ve seen her talking about diversity in hollywood, she uses ‘women of colour’.</p>

<p>she could just talk about Black women. but she is including us in her advocacy.</p>

<p>has anyone but me noticed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No- because first off she’s just doing what she’s supposed to be doing as far as they’re concerned- if she’s not singling out Blackness then they really don’t care- why praise something they think she’s owing them anyway?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>basically. and she’s not the only prominent Black woman who uses inclusive language in her advocacy. she’s just fresh on my mind bc i saw a gifset earlier with her doing exactly this.</p>

<p>but since we feel entitled to the labour of Black women, why bother recognize her for being really brave about her advocacy, since its quite possible her career will suffer for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think, speaking of careers suffering, my “favorite” argument in this oscars discourse was that someone boldly said that Black people have less to lose in this. Actually- I’m mad again, lemme find it:</p>

<blockquote><p>

Hmmm I get this but at the same time I feel like because black people have such a large presence in show business that they should use that presence to lift the voice of other minorities whose voices can’t be heard and may have something more to lose by speaking out. Why is this such a controversial idea

<br></p></blockquote>

<p>The person who said it was Black but like what the actual fuck- this is the sentiment I see from NBPoC all the time. Bitch where? We talk about this shit in our place of work outside of hollywood and we lose them jobs- you think just because someone’s in the media the stakes ain’t the same? Most times they’re even higher- there’s no real discrimination cases to fall back on if you continually don’t get cast because of some shit you said about bein Black in America. You just “weren’t right for the job”- they can blatantly say “Black isn’t what we’re looking for” already- how much more would it be if they decide to target you?</p>

*nods*

and its such a bizzare argument. if only bc it erases the fact that, many of the times I see Black women talking about this, they *do* advocate for 'women of colour' as a general class. Or they speak about diversity in broad, general terms. or they talk about their personal experience as a Black woman.

anyway. Black women have been including us in their stuff since they invented 'woman of colour' and we are anti-Black, entitled shitheads who take this so much for granted we can't even see it when its right in front of our faces.
