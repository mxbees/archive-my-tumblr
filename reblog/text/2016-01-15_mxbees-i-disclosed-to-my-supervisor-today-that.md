<p>I disclosed to my supervisor today that I had an autism. when she’s back in a few weeks we’re going to talk about accommodations. </p>

<p>I mostly told her bc i’m really really going to stop acting allistic bc i don’t care anymore bc i’m in a dead end position and my career is dead. and I just don’t have the fucking energy anymore.</p>

i also really really want to have to stop pretending like i can do things when i can't.

like. i want to be able to say, 'hey, i um, got nothing accomplished this week bc executive dysfunction and all i did was sometimes flail around at my desk or stare blankly at the monitor, sorry.'

none of it matters anymore.
