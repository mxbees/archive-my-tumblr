<p>The Asian-American ‘protests’ for Peter Liang aren’t just about anti-blackness itself, as if that means a thing in isolation. It’s also about what multicultural capitalist nationalism promises to migrants: no matter what the colour of their skin, if they uphold white supremacist capitalist ideals, then they’ll be permitted to chase success through white supremacist capitalism, almost as if they were white. The issue that the Asian-American groups are protesting, therefore, is not that an Asian-American cop was caught up in some tragic accident, but that Peter Liang was held accountable in murder where a white cop would be let off scot-free. The Asian-American groups are protesting against the broken promise of multicultural capitalist nationalism.</p>
<p>That Akai Gurley is black only serves to emphasise this broken promise: whiteness is built on the exploitation of blackness. Accessing whiteness through multicultural nationalism necessitates anti-blackness. Liang’s accountability, then, serves as a reminder for Asian-Americans that no matter how vocal their anti-blackness, they will never be considered white – at best, they will be white-but-not-white-enough. Anti-blackness, however blatant, doesn’t make one white. </p>
<p>To move forward we need to think about the shifting category of non-Indigenous, non-black, non-white peoples, how they flutter between white and not-white. We need to reflect on how multicultural nationalism feeds into white supremacist capitalism. Most of all, however, we (and I am speaking of the Asian diaspora in western societies when I say ‘we’) need to reflect on how we strategically use anti-blackness to access whiteness, how we will always denied full membership, and how we can begin to explore alternatives.</p>
<p>Let’s be clear: it’s one thing to navel gaze and say, ‘We need to examine anti-blackness’. It’s another thing to actively combat it in our respective communities, to listen actively and respectfully dialogue with black voices, and to create communities in which we can experiment with the full humanity denied us by imperialist white supremacist capitalist patriarchy.</p>
<p>Rest in power Akai Gurley.</p>

<p>I had no idea that this would blow up so I just want to say now that the term ‘white-but-not-white-enough’ was one I learnt from Toula Nicolacopoulos and George Vassilacopoulos’s ‘<a href="http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=413744534001496;res=IELIND">Racism, Foreigner Communities and the Onto-pathology of White Australian Subjectivity</a>’ from <i><a href="http://search.informit.com.au/browsePublication;isbn=0855754656;res=IELIND">Whitening Race: Essays in Social and Cultural Criticism</a></i>. </p>
<p>The concept of multicultural nationalism was from Sara Ahmed’s <i>The Cultural Politics of Emotion</i>, specifically the chapter ‘In the Name of Love’. </p>

<p>i hope OP realizes that this sounds like apologism. it also contains historically inaccurate information. anyway. i’m not quite sure what u were trying to accomplish with this post….</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can’t really speak to the historical research angle, but what I appreciated with this post was that it addressed the weird multiple binds recent immigrants (particularly those who <i>aren’t</i> refugees/asylum seekers because they deal with a whole <i>other</i> mess of situations) have to face - that tension of “you have to conform to whiteness to get any sort of recognition or access, but if you do so you’re selling out POC, and your presence here is gentrifying even though the main reason you’re here is because colonisation made it so that your home countries are underresourced and you have to come over to get any sort of advancement and make a better life” etc etc etc.</p>

<p>I find that a lot of social justice activists, particularly those who <i>haven’t</i> had to deal directly with the immigration system, really do not understand this. All sorts of migrants get thrown under the bus because we’re all somehow “buying into the system” even though no one really appreciates that <i>we don’t often have much of a choice </i>or even <i>know</i> that choices are available.</p>

<p>Take jobs as an example. The main reason I seriously contemplated joining the tech industry last year was because the tech industry was one of the very few that had its act together around H1Bs (US work permits), and if I wanted to stay in the US the H1B was the most viable option. This was in the Bay Area, in a time where so many of my peers were fighting <i>against</i> the tech industry because of issues like gentrification. Yet I didn’t see any of those people bother to think about how their companies and businesses can be more friendly to visa-seekers, none of them cared about making the H1B process fairer and easier on anyone who isn’t a tech industry people, they couldn’t be bothered. Here they are, demanding that I show how serious I am about building community by actually staying here rather than be a “transit” person, yet not doing anything to <i>help me stay here!</i> </p>

<p>(Eventually I couldn’t secure a job in time and this is why I am writing to you from Malaysia, but I still feel the effects of people who are all “why didn’t you stay?! Don’t you love us?! HOW DARE YOU” and I’m like “I fuckin TRIED not like you all were helping me out” like they wanted me to expend all that time and energy to keep them happy but not really extend any help in my direction.)</p>

<p>Is there tension with anti-blackness and anti-local-POC? Sure. This system is broken. But completely ignoring what recent migrants (and other visa-holders such as international students) have to go through is not helpful. We get exploited, we’re low on resources, we don’t get any access to resources (credit unions won’t take me, for example, cos I’m not “resident enough”). About the only things we <i>can</i> access to survive are the same systems that are fucking other people over. What do?</p>

i do get what you're saying. but the problem with OP and your reply, as far as the whole liang killing akai gurley thing is concerned, is that its really a derail.

it reads like apologism bc in this context it reads like OP is trying to excuse or rationalize the deaht of akai gurley.

moreover, what OP says about anti-Blackness pretty much shows that they haven't been doing what they claim they want people to do " to listen actively and respectfully dialogue with black voices"

like this?

> That Akai Gurley is black only serves to emphasise this broken promise: whiteness is built on the exploitation of blackness.

this is totally decentering Blackness from this discussion.

bc the way OP frames this, it sounds like they're talking about any given Chinese-American joining the police force, doing something 'bad', and then realizing that white supremacy will happily discard them.

it makes it sound like Liang was caught up in this thing. and then he killed a man. who just happened to be Black. 

idk. OP's whole post leaves a sour taste in my mouth. like i get where they are coming from and why they wrote what they wrote. but it still just sounds like OP is trying to rationalize both Liang's killing of Gurley and the asian-american protests. which is apologism.

like. it isn't even that OP is necessarily wrong, but i don't think this is the right time for this point and how it is framed really looks like OP is trying to pull attention away from anti-Blackness.
