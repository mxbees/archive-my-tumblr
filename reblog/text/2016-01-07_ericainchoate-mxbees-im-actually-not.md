<p>I’m actually not joking. one of the few great things about Being An Adult is the ability to eat popcorn for dinner if you want. </p>

<p>popcorn is on the list of about five things I can eat lately without feeling sick. and so I can choose something I like and can eat. without anyone trying to guilt me or coerce me into eating something else.</p>

<p>There’s this sexy hullless popcorn that the local convenience store chain sell here. Mostly vegan, a few dairy flavors (the cheese ones), $1.49 a pop for a decent size serving, and no funny ingredients. All natural snack food at a reasonable price! </p><p>I buy more of it than I should admit. It’s good, it’s whole grain, it’s not gonna kill you, and it’s filling. Love the stuff. </p></blockquote>

<p>yup. basically. </p><p>like. I just pop it on the stove and add salt. it takes like five or so minutes. the total cost is like.... less than a dollar. </p><p>and i'm now full and I don't feel like barfing. it's great.</p>
