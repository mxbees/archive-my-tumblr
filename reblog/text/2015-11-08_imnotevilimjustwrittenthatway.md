<p>I have a huge problem with the idea that there is no prediscursive moment for so many different reasons.</p>
<p>It’s actually absurdly essentialist (Discourse has been all, is all, will be all) and tautological.<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>honestly? it is also a type of linguistic determinism which. yeah. i don’t agree with.<br><br>sure sure. ppl like to pretend ‘discourse’ isn’t just language, but this how it frames itself nonetheless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s exactly what I meant with “it reminds me of Chomsky” since he is a big linguistic determinism proponent, at least with regards to the origin of language, lol. <br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>what does ‘prediscursive’ mean in this sense?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s close, but not exactly, the same thing as “pre-language.” It also means “pre-culture,” kind of (because discourse can’t exist without either, and both sort of implicate each other, since language is a big way culture gets transmitted).</p>
<p>I hope this made sense and wasn’t a garbage explanation.<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that does make sense.</p>
<p>And also, I am curious as to what ‘no prediscursive moment existed’ would even mean. That humans sprung fully formed into existence and discourse at some point? How would that work?</p>

honestly? the way i view this is that it is an epistemological claim.

essentially that even *if* stuff existed before discourse, whatever that is, is unknowable bc we can only interface with the world with discourse. 

as in, discourse is a necessary condition for knowledge of the world.

so like. the claim is less that no objects existed prior to discourse but, more or less, that nothing is or can be known about these objects.
