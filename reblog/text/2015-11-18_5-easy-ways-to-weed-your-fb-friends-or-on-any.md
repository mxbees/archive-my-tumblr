i just had the most wonderfully meta interaction about this post with someone on facebook. 

you see the title of this post, right? like. the intent is pretty clearly about removing ppl from your life.

comment: "while one is true, it'll alienate many Black and Latinx people bc blah blah blah"

me: "um... that's literally the point. alienating ppl."

response: "hdu be so rude!"

me: \*blocks\*

i didn't say anything about my own race or culture. as far as i know, pretty much all the parents in my family hit their kids. i know my lolo did. i also know that, for a while, i was totally one of those ppl who thought that 'some' hitting was okay, bc didn't i turn out okay?

accept i *didn't* turn out okay. and hitting kids is B A D.

and if me asserting this 'alienates' ppl. thats the fcking point. i either want you stop talking to me *forever* or identify yourself so i can block you and never talk to you again.

jesus.
