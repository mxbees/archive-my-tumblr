<p>okay, time to get real here. i know a lot of people have been on an archive of our own before, i know a lot of people write and post to an archive of our own, so i <i>know</i> it’s not a matter of nobody knowing what i’m talking about. i’m going to introduce to you a novel concept tho</p>
<p><b>ship tag etiquette</b>: </p>
<p>1. <b>don’t tag in your secondary and minor ships</b>. if your main ship in the fic is loki x hawkeye, awesome; tag that, and anyone looking for loki x hawkeye will basically know your fic is the place to go. if your main ship in the fic is loki x hawkeye, but you also tag the 4 other ships you <i>mention in like one sentence</i> out of the 50k fic you just wrote, then there are going to be a lot of people out there coming to your fic thinking <i>oh hey, at last a thor x sif fanfic sign me up</i> only to find out fast they’re wrong.</p>
<p>2. <b>don’t tag in your 

<b>secondary and</b>

minor ships</b>. it doesn’t matter if you dedicate those motherfucking sideships one paragraph out of 53, that’s like promising starving fic readers a treat and giving them <i>a fucking pea</i>. one pea. just one. maybe they are looking for fics with the actual ship whose tag they’re searching in, rather than: </p>
<ul><li>fics where their ship is used as a stepping stone to get to the main one<br></li>
<li>fics where their ship is tagged in because the writer thinks one mention makes it a ‘minor ship’ (IT DOESN’T, it’s just A MENTION OF IT)<br></li>
<li>fics where their ship is only tacked on to keep those characters busy and the main character of your fic only thinks about that ship in passing twice<br></li>
<li>fics where their ship is brought apart, by death or break up or infidelity, in any part of the fic just for the sake of the main ship to happen.<br></li>
</ul><p>3. <b>don’t tag in your 

<b>secondary and</b>

minor ships</b>. it’s just fucking rude. if i wanna get my rocks off reading superhot natasha romanoff x lady sif porn, do you know what i can find by going to their ship tag? DISAPPOINTMENT. because rather than learning that there are three/four fics focusing on their spacewives sex life, i have to sift through the mILLIONTY ONE HUNDRED fics already there, who center around loki. if i wanted to read about loki I’D JUST OPEN THE GODDAMN MCU TAG, IT’S ALL PEOPLE EVER WRITE ABOUT ANYWAY. </p>
<p>4. <b>don’t tag in your 

<b>secondary and</b>

minor ships</b>. i don’t care if you’ve done it once or twice, i don’t care if you think it’s necessary. it’s not. if you think it’s necessary, you know what you could do? add a note at the beginning. a OH BY THE WAY GUYS THISFIC WILL ALSO INCLUDE SOME SIDE SHIPS SUCH AS […] or you can let the readers figure it out. </p>
<p>5. <b>don’t tag in your 

<b>secondary and</b>

minor ships</b>. because those of us who go into those tags looking for fics about them where they’re appreciated and portrayed well and <i>are the main focus</i> will be left facing the origin of our supervillain story. every. single. day. </p>
<p>6. <b>if you’ve tagged in 

<b>secondary and</b>

your minor ships: </b>do us all and yourself a favour and go delete them. do it now. edit them now. you’ll be thanked, and most importantly, you’ll be appreciated twice: once by you readers, once by the people who don’t have to get annoyed anymore at seeing fics promising them an apple and giving them <i>a fucking pea</i>. </p>
