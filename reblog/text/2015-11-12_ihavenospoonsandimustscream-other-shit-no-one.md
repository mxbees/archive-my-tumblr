<p>Other shit no one told me about:</p>
<p>starting T can cause hot flashes (this was my FAVORITE /s) and cause your piss to smell strange</p>
<p>your tolerance for sweets will go down</p>
<p>it will take for fucking ever for your voice to break. you’ll have your voice crack all the time until it finally decides to stop.</p>
<p>if you get facial hair, it will come in incredibly patchy.</p>
<p>contrary to popular opinion/insistence, the changes aren’t usually super fast, noticeable, or strong. it could be several years before your face changes visually (other than facial hair), for instance. that bit about t being stronger/more potent than estrogen? that’s basically pretty much transmisogynistic bullshit.<br></p>
