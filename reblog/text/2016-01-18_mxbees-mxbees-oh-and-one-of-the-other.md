<p>oh. and one of the other major reason i know i vagueblog these days</p>

<p>is that the state of the Discourse in the interwebs</p>

<p>is such that ppl often take criticism as some kind of moral judgement about their character as a person.</p>

<p>and if not them, then other people will jump in with this kind of attitude</p>

<p>and then it blossoms into a Thing.</p>

<p>usually, i just want to talk about the idea/content of a post</p>

<p><em>without</em> making it about the person who posted or reblogged it.</p>

<p>without possibly exposing them to harassment (bc, yeah, this has happened before)</p>

<p>i’ve long abandoned the idea that someone reblogging something problematic means anything about them as a person.</p>

<p>on twitter its pretty common to see ppl write in their bios</p>

<p>‘retweets are not an endorsement’</p>

<p>one Major Problem i have with tumblr’s culture is that reblogs are <em>absolutely</em> viewed as endorsements.</p>

<p>i’m not saying ppl have zero culpability for any harm caused by reblogging shitty things, but that you often can’t reblog to critique the content of the reblog without the person offering an apology.</p>

<p>its all too much for me these days.</p>

<p>this is one of the major reasons i pretty much don’t reblog <em>anything</em> other than donation posts these days.</p>

<p>i can’t handle the anxiety of knowing ppl will hold me as responsible for reblogging a problematic thing as the OP. i get enough shit for the stuff i write. and that’s enough for me.</p>

then add in the reality that ppl will also hold you responsible for any shitty reblogs your own followers might do...

its a wonder anyone bothers reblogging anything.

i literally cannot handle the additional cognitive and emotional burden of thinking about how i could be held responsible for what other ppl post and i reblog, and then what comments ppl might add to anything post i reblogged.

yeah. i'm aware of how fucking convoluted this thread sounds. but that's exactly my point. its too much for me.

and so i pretty much will only reblog donation posts and, once in a while, respond to comments on my own posts and, even more rarely, reblog someone else to add a comment.

but ... 99% of the time it just isn't worth the effort anymore.
