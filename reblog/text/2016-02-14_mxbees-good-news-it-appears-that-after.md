<p>good news! it appears that, after everything, i’ll be getting tits this year. my request for funding was approved so….</p>

<p>T I T S</p>

<p>sometime in the next few months, i will complete my magical transformation into a Busty Superstar.</p>

<p>i’m guessing this also means i ought to try and get my remaining chest hair removed bc shaving around curves seems like i’m just begging to cut myself.</p>

<p>but apparently… this could be my first summer of tank tops with no bra. lol.</p>

<p>(i’m still a little ambivalent about it. but since i have the opportunity, i’m going to try having boobs for a while and see how i like it. i have always wanted tits but resigned myself years ago that i’d never have the money. and now that i do…. well. i’m not going to pass it up.)</p>

the other awesome thing?

is that after this surgery, i'll still have about 3000 that i'm allowed to claim before i hit the lifetime maximum with my union...

which will probably all go to hair removal and clothes.
