<p>Definitely going to have to write a what is good faith post, since it is extremely obvious that I am going to be dealing with anti-so sorts in the near future.</p>

<p>The number of “you are ugly” messages and the number of private messages telling me that or trying to make me understand that the Slave trade was really African american’s fault has been surprising.</p>

<p>But holy shit, the inability to understand a simple concept like good faith and that one cannot have a debate or conversation without it and that as a result, all those rules of evidence and debate and so forth do not apply they have is gag worthy.</p>

<p>Terfs are better at it than they are.</p>

<p>Then I see a reblogging of one of these racist apologia writing types on a friends blog.</p>

<p>Gonna get ugly.</p>

i gave up on the whole good faith thing ages ago.

which is pretty much why i don't discuss anything anymore with anyone i don't already know
