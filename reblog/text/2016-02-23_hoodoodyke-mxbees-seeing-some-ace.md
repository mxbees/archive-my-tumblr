<p>seeing some ace positivity thing and… the last point is ‘no one is broken’</p>

<p>which contradicts their other point that u know ur identity better than anyone else.</p>

<p>u know what i know about myself? that i’m broken.</p>

<p>i don’t think asexuality has anything to do with it.</p>

<p>but i’m broken nonetheless.</p>

<p>like its great and all to try and tell ppl they aren’t broken.</p>

<p>but i also want a world where those of us who <em>are</em> broken are</p>

<p>affirmed, loved, supported, etc.</p>

<p>Especially because there are people who are ace bc they are broken from trauma…</p>
