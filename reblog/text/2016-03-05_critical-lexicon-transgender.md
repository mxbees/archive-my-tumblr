<blockquote>
<p><p>‘Transgender’ is a term chosen in the early 90s as a “way to describe the sociopolitical alignment of interests between multiple groups who face discrimination, harassment &amp; violence due to having non-conforming gender expressions”<sup id="fnref:p140513990268-norris02"><a href="#fn:p140513990268-norris02" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. As such, it wasn’t intended to be seen as a primary, personal identity but as a way to signal political intent and affiliation. These days, however, it has become the primary identity used by many 'gender non-conforming’ people.</p>

<p>People of colour may or may not find value in this as a term, either as political or identity label. Historically and in many current communities of colour, 'transgender’ only ever imperfectly maps onto the pre-existing social context. Identifying as 'transgender’ isn’t necessary for legitimizing your 'non-conforming’ identity, especially if you want to avoid the trans*nationalist and imperial aspects of the term (in addition to avoiding the attendent identity policing in many white trans communities).</p>

trying to make all of this more accessible.

i've set myself a word limit for defining these things. no more than 250 words (this one is about 150).
