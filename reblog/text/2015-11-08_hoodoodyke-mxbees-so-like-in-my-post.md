<p>so. like. in my post about nihilism, i use the theological worldview of chrisitanity as a way to counter some of the ideas.</p>

<p>this was actually purposeful. many of us have histories of violent conversion. such that, like in the PH, the majority of us are ‘catholic’ or, more broadly, christian. this is simply the reality of the world we live in today.</p>

<p>imo decolonization is meaningless if it fails to take this into account. if you propose a theory and path to liberation that, at its core, basically asks that ppl abandon their gods, you’ll not only have a hard time selling to ppl of faith but it is unlikely that you’ve adequately managed to ground your theory in anything resembling reality for a lot of ppl.</p>

<p>yes. there is something to be said here, as well, about indigenous spiritualities and worldviews, but i didn’t actually take this approach bc some of the advocates for this theory are Indigenous.</p>

<p>the choice of something imposed violently via colonialism was definitely intentional.</p>

<p>while. sure. i imagine that there are ppl out there who think that the One True Path™ to decolonization means a rejection of our colonizer’s religion… i have my doubts that this is true. but even if it is? then i think decolonization is doomed to fail.</p>

<p>some of us have nothing to ‘go back to’, in that the violence of colonialism has either been totally or mostly successful in erasing/destroying/whatever our traditional beliefs. that maybe they only live on in the ways that we took a tool of violence (religion) and made it into something of our own (like the folk catholicism of the philippines).</p>

<p>and i think you need a better argument than ‘i don’t believe in the christian god, thus he couldn’t have made us the way we are, thus there is no pre-discursive body’.</p>

<p>yeah. and this is exactly the sort of thing that academic theories always fail to take into account. you know. actual ppl and our lives.</p>

<p>(and i haven’t even said anything about how completely fucked up it is to make atheism – or some variation – a precondition to liberation.)</p>

<p>I’m morbidly curious on how this conceptualization of decolonization takes into account spiritual and magical pratices such as hoodoo/rootwork. How do you decolonize something that has been so intermingled with christianity, that it ceases to exist without it?<br><br>How do you justify the further destruction of a pathway that holds the collective knowledge of a people, surviving in the only way it can?<br><br>I think a lot of my issues with decolonization as it’s presented academically, and then translated into movements, is that they do not often take the approach of moving forward. Instead, they take this approach of “tear down everything that has happened, and go back to the way it was.” Like?? That’s not how humanity and culture works. That has never been how it works. That’s not even how individual people work. You can never go back.<br><br>I rarely see how to move FORWARD. I just see “destroy what is here.” Which, okay, yeah, I hate what is here, but where will we go after?</p>

yes! exactly. i mean.

when i was writing this i also had in mind the role of the church in Black american communities. i mean. i went to a predominantly Black church for a few years. and honestly? the difference between a Black church and any other kind of church i've ever been to cannot be overstated.

for me. the hallmark of whether or not i think an idea has any chance of being actual decolonization is whether or not it has room for the descendents of enslaved Africans.
