<p>now i’m trying to figure out how i feel about getting reblogged to ‘toniarguingwithtransphobes’…</p>

<p>not sure if it was intentional or not.</p>

<p>also another reminder why i don’t really bother reblogging stuff with commentary anymore.</p>

<p>although this particular case is different than the normal situation, since we’re both right, relative to our domains of discourse. one of the classic problems with inter-disciplinary discussions.</p>

<p>which kind of leaves me with no… real way to respond? bc i agree with her comment. and her critique is valid, using social science as a frame of reference. it’s not quite accurate if we use logic as the domain of reference.</p>

<p>and since i’m not a social scientist of any kind and my argument was meant to be read within the domain of logic, i’m not really able to switch domains of reference since, relative to Toni, i’m pretty ignorant in her field of specialty.</p>

<p>alternatively, i <em>could</em> explain how and why my argument is successful within the domain of logic, but since being ‘right’ isn’t actually the point of my comment, i don’t really feel motivated to defend my position. again, primarily, bc as far as i’m concerned we are both right. or both wrong, depending on how you want to slice it.</p>

<p>It was unintentional. I had just reblogged someone else, didn’t catch it in time.</p>

<p>Very, very sorry for my mistake.</p>

ah good to know. thanks for clarifying (and no real apology needed, since i do get how easy it is to reblog to the wrong blog).
