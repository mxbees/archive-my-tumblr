<p>I know a lot of ppl still don’t get what I mean about survival being messy and full of sin </p>

<p>seeing a white person try and emotionally blackmail a bunch of disabled poc by saying,  ‘this is her life!  she’ll die!’ </p>

<p>like<br><br>
I’m sorry for that. I am. but better ppl than her die miserable pointless deaths everyday. </p>

<p>I hate it. I do.</p>

<p>but do I care about this one particular person whose made it very clear that she gives zero fucks whether my friends live? </p>

<p>I care. but not enough. </p>

<p>not enough to keep reblogging her pleas for aid. not enough to actually do much of anything to prevent her from dying. </p>

<p>not proud of this mind you. but it’s true nonetheless.</p>

<p>I don’t care at all and I am proud enough for the both of us, so it’s coo’.</p>
