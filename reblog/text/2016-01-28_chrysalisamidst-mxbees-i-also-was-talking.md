<p>i also was talking about a different class of white trans women i’m fucking tired of:</p>

<p>the Trans Representative™</p>

<p>like. seeing an(nother) interview with a bland, boring white trans woman</p>

<p>who just ‘stumbled into activism’</p>

<p>and now has this Platform</p>

<p>all i can think of is</p>

<p>if u really and truly cared</p>

<p>u’d stfu and stop taking up so much space</p>
