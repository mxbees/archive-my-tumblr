i guess for me an argument distinguishes itself from a disagreement in how heated things get? like. an argument can include yelling or whatever. 

idk. i guess you can disagree with someone, get upset with them, get annoyed, get frustrated, get angry, all that without it being an argument.

er... i guess another way that i'm looking at this is that many people basically equivocate between 'argument' and 'fight'.

so if we make a clear distinction, then its really fighting i don't think is (a necessary) part of a relationship, rather than arguments.
