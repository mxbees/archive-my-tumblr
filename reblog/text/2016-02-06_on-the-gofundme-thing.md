<p>I must clearly state I do not object to fair, clear objections such as which <a class="tumblelog" href="http://tmblr.co/mc_Q09cy8Gr_t4x-kJttZCw">@greenskyoverme</a> laid. Who’s also awesome, and thank you. It’s what came after that wasn’t so great.</p>
<p>I do object to white people scoring valuable ally points by upbraiding the existence of my fundraiser. I’m sorry, alas, that it’s necessary, but we live in a world where psychological care is considered a luxury. In deciding to call out the horde rather than having an ounce of understanding this is a hard decision, the decision to call out someone with no understanding of their reality and pronounce them co-signing killer cops…sorry, that’s fucked up, and that’s white insecurity being used as a battering ram to harm, well, me. </p>
<p>That said:</p>
<p>1. After white HBSers reported my Patreon and got it permalocked by saying it belongs to a man, I have been super leery about this shit on the internet. I get pretty consistent MRAsshole harassment, and the HBSer/white New Trans Separatist set, you know the WKSS folks…they’re going to keep bullying. As the person running the fundraiser has an established account, even though it’s with a shitty company, the decision was made to use them as complaints would have less weight. </p>
<p>2. I am leery about doing business with YouCaring because a known scammer in the local area runs their fundraiser through them, and I’m already being accused of pretty awful shit. Additionally, WePay can’t verify me for reasons they have been unable to explain, as my license, bank account title, and account all say the same thing but there’s no way to reach them to get resolution. You can’t, as it’s been explained to me, have a YouCaring without a WePay account. Known repeat scammer + people are gonna say I’m shitty for asking for money + can’t confirm account = this is an obstacle to adoption.</p>
<p>3. Sacrifices suck, but sometimes they have to happen. Already, I have to present an accountability framework for this to avoid, you know, WKSS sorts punching down. (I mean, hell, the insecure white racist trans woman who threw the permaban/contact ban on me has had 6 just since WKSS was a thing. She’s allowed to beg, I’m a fucking monster for it. Ponder what priorities that expresses.) This requires involvement of others. This is the framework available. </p>
<p>4. There’s a reason I offered an alternative path, which admittedly has less accountability and will also get me accused of being shitty. That was offered for these reasons on top of foreign exchange rates. </p>
<p>5. I’m sure one’s white ass can find other things to object to than the existence of my fundraiser, and yet they don’t. One’s white ass commences punching down to score valuable ally points, rather than providing a structured and nuanced criticism, and uses terms like “blood money” in the name of demonizing.</p>
<p>So. </p>
<p>Learn not to lash out at people in need to feel better about yourself and preserve white supremacy in the name of equating my ass to a killer cop. That’s fucked up, and you have no earthly clue what I’m facing, nor did you bother reading what I added to it, but just kept going for blood.</p>
<p>I hope you’re happy with yourself, but you’re preserving what you claim to speak against, have no clue what I’m dealing with, and pretty much derailed things. You want to speak against white supremacy? Get your fucking boot off my neck and try this “empathy” thing.</p>
<p>Or don’t, I don’t give a fuck. </p>

here's a great example of the ideological purity thing i've been talking about. about how notions of purity lead to abusive communities and situations.

i mean. ffs. 

all she's trying to do is raise some money for healthcare. 
 
yes. gofundme sucks. so does paypal. so does pretty much any and every thing to do with capitalism. its a fucking shit system that makes us all into sinners. 
 
but... instead of just letting her, you know, debase herself for money in peace, ppl have to use her specific donation post as their personal soapbox for why gofundme is garbage? 

in anycase [checkout the fundraiser post and help Erica get some healthcare!](http://ericainchoate.tumblr.com/post/138739633462/click-here-to-support-ericas-spoon-fund-by-amy)
