<p>the idea that everyone is brought up on oppressive attitudes that they are obligated to unlearn to no longer be liable for violence on a societal scale is imo the single most ableist idea that sj communities on this site are promoting. we’ve all seen numerous posts critiquing the lack of disability/mental illness accessibility in education and the workplace, but the fact is, coercion toward activity is never not ableist/sanist. the moral obligation to learn about social oppression is particularly dependent on the assumption that everyone has the ability to engage in intensive self education and do so without causing mental/physical harm. the encouragement of self scrutiny also disregards the way that neurodivergent people function + is a perpetuation of the ways in which disabled people are already scrutinised for excuses to mistreat us irl.</p>

<p>Well the first sentence doesn’t work because you can’t unlearn privilege… The rest- is there any way to translate those sentences that doesn’t end up looking like “I can’t not be racist because disabled”?</p>

<p>Are you white? This focus solely on disability/ableism makes me think you are very fuckin white. If not, I’m still over here like whatchudoin. </p>

<p>the context is that i’m actually very very physically tired and severely disabled, you are proving my point, 9 notes in.<br></p>

<p>Cool, cool, I am both of those things too, and Black, and it’s still lookin like “I don’t want to engage in not being racist because disabled” on your end, and on my end it’s looking like “I’m very bedridden, tired, and I get shat on by racists hourly” soooo</p>

huh. one could say that i've been known to hold the position in the first sentence. that ppl have some moral obligation to, you know, *not oppress people*.

bc that's what it comes down to. this isn't about personal attitudes but about structural violence.

the kind of structural violence that makes a non-Black person feel entitled to Black labour while trying to dodge moral accountability for anti-Blackness (personal and structural). 

the amusing thing is that this is a self-defeatist attitude.

if what sophaldred says is true, that there is a sufficient level of disability (or whatever) that excuses a person from moral accountability for what they do, i'm unclear why they think that anyone should bother not being ablest towards them. 

anyway. seeing how you're both willing to demand Black labour and then distort criticisms of the very Black femme you demanded labour from. i hope you realize this is more than just an 'attitude' but your active participation in the oppression of another person.

for which, yes, you are morally accountable.
