<p>things i’m happy i did today:</p>

<ul><li>write a bash wrapper for the pinboard api</li>
<li>clean</li>
<li>do a fresh manicure</li>
</ul><p>i wanted to clean more than i ended up doing, but then there was barfing and so i didn’t.</p>

<p>(also just ate popcorn which usually isn’t any issue for me… but now i feel like barfing some more. but i’m going to keep it on the inside, i think.)</p>

<p>Did you post up your nails?</p></blockquote>

<p>I haven't. but i will now. very boring though bc i destroyed them so they are short and a boring colour.</p>
