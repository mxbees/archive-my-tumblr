<p>ok…</p>

<p>so now that i’ve realized that maybe its yeast causing my tummy problems after i eat bread</p>

<p>finding reliable information about yeast intolerances is actually really hard.</p>

<p>in part bc the common yeast is something u already have in ur tummy.</p>

<p>and bc there is a bunch of white hippy science out there about ‘candidas’</p>

<p>making it difficult to separate information from white hippy garbage.</p>

<p>but really.<br/><br/>most of the 'candida diet' shit is pretty unsustainable and nonsensical. the list of foods is just... not something i can do. at all.<br/><br/>like. i'm going to stop eating as much (or all) bread. but... that's probably about it.<br/><br/>and i might try the probiotic thing that my doctor recommended, since that should help.<br/><br/>and the other stuff "reducing sugar" is already something i'm supposed to be doing for my liver anyway.<br/><br/>(also makes sense bc i haven't been good about my diet in about a week, so the fact that i'm having a lot of trouble is unsurprising.)</p>
