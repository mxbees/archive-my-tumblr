<p>i got the basics down and i’ve been experimenting for a few weeks now.<br><br>while i normally don’t think the order of the ingredients matters all that much, it really did make a difference this time.</p>

[Here's the chocolate brownie](https://notes.pinboard.in/u:biyuti/d5b2b43d5bcbe36e43d8)

[And here's the cookie](https://notes.pinboard.in/u:biyuti/0f814d4504639f2e48c7)

i would believe that the cookie would be better with an egg yolk as most recipes had, but... i didn't want to do that, lol.

observations so far:

- using butter is better than oil (if you use at all).
- milk isn't strictly necessary (you can just sub water as in the brownie)
- for both, i prefer using brown sugar bc i think it tastes better.
- you can play with the proportions if you want, as long as you end up with a batter consistency of maybe... pudding.
- mixing the wet ingredients first and adding the flour slowly does make a difference (it doesn't always in macro baking)

all in all, i haven't really ended up with anything i *hated* but... its definitely not the same as actually baking something (the microwaves are not equivalent to the heat of the oven)

however, if u have a sweetooth like i do but need to watch what you eat (bc of actual medical problems), its a great way to satisfy a craving *without* having to make an entire batch of cookies that you then... eat. all. of. them.

i'm going to start playing around with peanut butter and molasses next.
