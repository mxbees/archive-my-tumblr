<p>suddenly feeling like I should start working on being a better writer. like. start editing before I post? </p>

<p>idk. I like just writing and then posting. but. if I’m going to be serious about treating this like a job, I should maybe start working on improving? </p>

<p>most of the writing things I see are mostly about fiction. how does one get better at writing nonfiction (other than practising since I write often ebough).</p>

<p>Maybe you can look at your fav nonfiction pieces and see that stands out as effective. Like in terms of how they use sources, how they structure arguments, …and then try to mimic their style of writing? Idk really…</p>

i would do this...

but i'm a little to easily influenced by other ppl's writing. its taken me a long time to really carve out a (i hope) distinctive style/etc.

idk.
