how much are you paying for this?

how are you different from a thousand other ppl who don't experience transmisogyny and want to exploit us?

is ur school article going to anything that a bunch of other sensationalist articles about the suffering twoc have done? (which is fucking nothing)

maybe u could just write about how ~dmab trans individuals of colour~ are in constant danger of being exploited by an amoral media?
