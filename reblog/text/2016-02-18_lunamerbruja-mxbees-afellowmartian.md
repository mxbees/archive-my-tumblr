<p>holy fuck. i’m trying to organize my steven universe episodes.</p>

<p>and there are like… four different orderings to the seasons online.</p>

<p>wtf.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>after spending <em>way</em> too much time. i have them all in the ‘right’ order.</p>

<p>except that it probably <em>isn’t</em> the right order.</p>

<p>what is the right order? no one seems to know.</p>

<p>what a fucking mess.</p>

<p>:\</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is literally no correct order it’s very confusing. My SU folder is a complete mess.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>totally ok to reply</p>

<p>i went with the ordering of one of ppl on the team?</p>

<p>who basically said that the intended order listed was what they’d want on a blue-ray release.</p>

<p>(i really fucking hope they put out a dvd of the entire thing, though)</p>

<p>at least now they are all numbered and there aren’t any overlaps or repeated episodes.</p>

<p>it’ll have to be good enough. lol.</p>

<p>i can share the list i made if u want.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i had no idea there were other ways to organize the episodes other than by when they were released? </p>

<p>is there an intended order to watch? wow! i’m really interested in knowing more!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://mxb.ca/post/139540520584/my-steven-universe-episode-order">i just shared the order i went with complete with sources to four different orders</a></p>

<p>its really fucking confusing.</p>

<p>normally, i’d got by the IMDB airdates, but they don’t have a season 2 episode 2.</p>

<p>so…. i’m like. wtf?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i think this explains why we kept watching the same two SU episodes. xD thanks for putting an order together!</p>
</blockquote>

god yeah.

and why even though i kept re-downloading, the episodes would appear 'mis labelled'.

bleh.
