<blockquote><p>(i posted this on facebook)</p>

<p>The easiest way to determine if a group of people was white in the early days of colonization is a simple checklist of the most important white privileges:</p>

<ol><li>Could they become citizens?</li>
<li>Could they own enslaved Black people?</li>
<li>Could they own property?</li>
<li>Could they marry white people?</li>
</ol><p>If the answer to all of these questions is &#8216;yes&#8217;, then the group was white. Irish people could do all of these things from the moment they arrived to settle in the americas.</p>

<p>I will say this as much as is needed&#8230;. (this was posted in a comment thread elsewhere).</p>

<p>Only white people are able to answer &#8216;yes&#8217; to all of these questions, esp. during the early days of colonization in the Americas. These were literally, at the time, the biggest and most important white privileges.</p></blockquote>

<p>the great thing about this four part test is that it shows just how stable the boundaries of whiteness have been <br/><br/>and how no one really seems to talk about the actual edge cases in terms of whiteness (west asians and north africans)<br/><br/>instead we are constantly hearing about the fucking irish or east europeans, who've always been white.</p>
