question: "trans men are actually female and trans women are actually male! queer theorists just don't want to admit it!" there's nothing radical about saying or implying that trans people are not the gender they are, or claiming that trans women are biologically "male" and therefore are not fully women. Smh. Biggest load I've seen on my dash in a while.

<blockquote><p>i mean&hellip; forget radical, it isn’t even special or rare.</p><p>i literally read this shit every day. from conservatives. from religious right ppl. from trans men. from cis women. <br/></p><p>boring and pedestrian.</p><p>(also&hellip; sorry for putting that on everyone’s dash. but&hellip; i mostly wanted to point out that this really REALLY isn’t a fringe view and that it is gaining wider/popular traction bc there is a growing backlash coming for trans women bc of recent hypervisibility.)<br/></p></blockquote><p>
<p>oops. one group i forgot to mention in that list was socialists, radfems, other ppl on the left.<br/><br/>pretty much no one actually thinks that trans women are women. <br/><br/>(gee... wonder if this has something to do with the level of violence...)</p></p>
