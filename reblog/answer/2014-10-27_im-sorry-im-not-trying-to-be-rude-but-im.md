question: I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be rude, but I'm having issues figuring out how pride flags are colonial?

<blockquote><p>i should note that the initial inspiration for this notion comes from voz.</p>

<p>i guess for me it also seems like this should be self apparent….</p>

<p>anyway.</p>

<p>the first and most apparent way is the fact that these various movements and identities, as articulated wihtin a settler state and given a symbolic ‘flag’ — a symbol most usually associated with nations is necessarily an act of white settler colonialism since the white ppl in charge of these movements are, well, settlers on stolen land. thus, given themselves a flag and, thus, symbolically claiming nationhood while occupying land that isn’t theirs is well, like literal and actual colonialism. settler colonialism, to be specific. that is why these flags, rather than being symbolic of some kind of identity or community, represent homonationalism (homoimperialism) at its very finest.<br/><br/>sure. some ppl are probably going to respond with <br/><br/>"these flags aren’t declarations of nationhood, but of community solidarity" <br/><br/>but all i can think is: why did these symbols of ~community~ solidarity have to be _flags_? <br/><br/>furthermore, as symbols of solidarity, we can also see that the flags are dismal and total failures. the original pride flag was created with some notion of representing the entire community, but as that post shows, the proliferation of flags shows that this is a failure.<br/><br/>the second way is that these flags have literally become ‘global’ symbols of the ‘gay’ rights movement. it enforces a mythology whereby the white, settled US/canada and white europe are framed as naturally more progressive and the leaders for human rights. all other countries are supposed to look towards the centre of the empire and judge themselves in relation to this. <br/><br/>this becomes a serious problem when you see ppl asking fa’fafine in Samoa, who recently won a major victory for their rights (ie, decriminalizing homosexuality) about ‘gay marriage’ and they, themselves, say they don’t really care about it. but then you look at the wiki page <br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Samoa">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Samoa</a><br/><br/>and u can see that literally only two issues are mentioned. the criminal laws and ‘same-sex’ marriage. and i’m not even getting into the fucking ridiculousness of askign fa’fafine about ‘same-sex’ marriage and how fucking colonial that shit is. <br/><br/>third. the gay rights movement itself (ie Gay Inc) is a product of colonial movements. in this, i’m talking about the systemic and purposeful exclusion of trans women of colour, other queer ppl of colour, from a movement we started. like white ppl literally came in and occupied and copted and fucking stole the entire thing. <br/><br/>and then they put a flag on it. shipped it off to the rest of the world. <br/><br/>homo.nationalism.imperialism.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what’s wrong with that? <br/>We are declaring ourselves soverign. We are saying, with our colonial flag, that this is our world too and we have every right to exist in it. We are colonising culture, and bringing to it that very central part of us that has been ignored for so long, and just in the fashion that land-colonisation did, we will create a new culture, and hopefully it will be better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Just in the fashion of land-colonialism."</p>
<p>You know that “land colonialism” was systematic genocide and murder of millions of people globally right? Or are you just some wannabe genocidal creep who wishes he could make any sense of thought and reason?</p>
<p>Don’t answer that, Columbus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My point was that the pride movement has nothing to do with killing people. <br/>Do you realise how ridiculous that sounds? <br/>I don’t understand why everyone has to pick things apart to find something to be offended by. It is a flag. It is rainbow. It does not mean we are an invading bunch of white people that intend to rape, pillage, and plunder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You missed the original point completely and compared it intentionally to ACTUAL physical colonization which was not what ANYONE has posited except for you. We didn’t compare you to actual arbiters of genocide, you did. All that was being said was that this cultural imperialism was an extension of those crimes, and you took pride in that instead of understanding its time to stop fucking colonizing other cultures and their own forms of gender expression.</p>
<p>You are the one who took their point literally when it was figurative. The movement of a white flag of pride literally colonizes other cultures that are already suffering from the actual effects of murder and genocide and you made it sound like that was a great thing in the name of “”progress.”” The point being that white people like yourself think “carving out a space” with a reminiscent flag and all, all while erasing thousands of other cultural expressions of gender and sexuality is apparently okay cos white people can only be horrible if they’re being actively and physically violent.</p>
<p>What you are failing unsurprisingly to understand is that European concepts of gender and sexual orientation are not the be all end all, and in fact, where the basis for genocide by creating a standard of what humans are “supposed” to be: which to them was white men and white women, no one else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a very far-off conclusion. Frankly, I’m tired of detractors like yourself finding ways to change the meaning of the movement (keep in mind the position you hold was started by the religious end of the nonwhite community, who has other motives for stopping the movement).</p>
<p>I’m sorry that the Pride movement isn’t actually all about every single different thing about everyone.</p>
<p>The movement exists to win equality for Bisexuals, Lesbians, Gays, and Trans people. That is it’s only goal, and that’s a goal I stand behind.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that there aren’t other goals to reach for. There are a lot of things that need to change, but this movement is not aiming to fix those things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"i’m tired of detractors like yourself finding ways to change the meaning of the movement"</p>
<p>what. might i ask, would <em>you</em> fucking know about a movement started by twoc? u literally have zero place to be speaking AT ALL about what the movement is and means, given that u have no fucking understading of history.</p>
<p>"the position you hold was started by the religious end of the nonwhite community"</p>
<p>r u fucking srs rn?</p>
<p>EVERYONE. LOOK AT THIS CRACKER TRYING TO BLAME POC FOR TRYING TO STOP GAY INC.</p>
<p>u’ve been reading too much dan savage.</p>
<p>but u blame teh Black church for passing prop8 too.</p>
<p>fuck u</p>
<p>white supremacist colonizer garbage</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like how this devolved into shitslinging almost immediately.</p><p>As if cultural symbols exist in a vacuum, as if any other cultural symbol of solidarity and identity is as easy to carry around.  This kind of bullshit argument could be used to say poc churches and christian faith derivatives are basically just internalized oppression and I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s even close to a complete argument.</p><p>Let&#8217;s break it down: what, exactly, would happen in a world where we recognize this flawed reasoning and take away flags? Well, parades would suck, and there&#8217;d be a whole hell of a lot of problems at rallies, and the lgbtqa+ community would effectively be stripped of a powerful and ubiquitous symbol.  That&#8217;s all this amounts to: not a more ethical form of representation, just the removal of empowering symbolism.</p></blockquote>

<p>'stripped of a powerful symbol'</p><p>u know what i see when i look at the pride flag?</p><p>how white gays and lesbians colonized and stole this movement from girls like me and from Black and Latina trans women</p><p>how they then systematically pushed us out while co_opting our suffering and death</p><p>how this is still happening</p><p>gleefully excused by shitbags like u who think that a symbol of homonationalism matters more than freedom and justice</p>
