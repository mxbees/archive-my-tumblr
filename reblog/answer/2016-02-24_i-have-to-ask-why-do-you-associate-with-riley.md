i'm guessing not. 

pretty sure this is coming out bc riley put themself into the spotlight again.

just so everyone is clear:

**i will not be justifying who i chose to 'associate' with.**

if u've bought into whatever smear campaign targetted against someone i 'associate' with and u think this makes me guilty by association.

fine.

unfollow or block.

but don't send me messages like this.
