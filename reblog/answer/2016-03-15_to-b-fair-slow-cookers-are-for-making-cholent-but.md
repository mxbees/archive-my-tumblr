question: To b fair, slow cookers are for making cholent but u aren't gonna see a lot of goys doing that. Rice cookers being used for stuff other than rice is useful if you don't have anything else to cook with so good 4 low income. Hope that's not derailing

its also irritating bc i had a white friend or whatever who constantly 'teased' me that using a rice cooker was 'lazy'.</p>
