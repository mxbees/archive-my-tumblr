question: Do you mind explaining what mestizaje ideology is, and why you don't like it?

<blockquote><p>Mestizaje is this Latin American belief that all Latin Americans are mixed people. </p>

<p>It’s not false to say that there are Mestizos in Latin America. In fact, many MANY are. In some regions, the majority of people are mixed-race. <br/>
However, what Mestizaje sometimes does is conflate all the ethnic and racial identities found within Latin America into one ideal identity; you are Latinx therefore you are mixed. <br/>
Maybe this is coming from an Americanized standpoint of how race works, but just because my neighbor is asian and they’ve been my neighbor for 50 years, doesn’t mean I get to claim asian ancestry.</p>

<p>Speaking as a caribeño, mestizo to us generally (meaning it’s possible to have different meanings) means  someone of tri-racial mixed heritage— African, Indigenous and European. Again, it is not wrong to believe that there are such people in the Caribbean, but it denies the fact that there are folks who are not mixed. Some people only have African or only have European or only have indigenous ancestry. It also ignores that there are Asian latinxs in the area who are just as Latinx as everyone else. </p>

<p>Mestizaje might be helpful for folks who don’t know that far back into their ancestry but it also causes racial and ethnic identities to be viewed as a national or regional thing. Here’s what it has the tendency of causing people to say and believe: “I’m from x country and in this country there are indigenous, Europeans and Africans therefore I am (as an individual person) all those things”. </p>

<p>That is flawed because not everyone is treated the same. Indigenous folks are treated like indigenous people. Look at the treatment of The Shuar and Quechua communities in Ecuador/Peru. <br/>
African descendants are treated as such. Look at various black communities in Colombia. Look at how many Afrodecendientes are in Colombia and then ponder on why no one ever knows that Colombia has one of the largest populations of black people in the region. </p>

<p>Mestizaje as an ideology does a very poor job at discussing white supremacist and racist power structures that continue to exist in Latin America. It denies that colorism affects us.</p></blockquote>
<p>Errr so point of order on this post because necessary since it wasn’t mention:</p>
<p>In the US Latino community by large, being dominated by Chicano intellectual thought as it is, Mestizo points only to mixing between the European ancestry and Indigenous ancestry as established by roughly the past 60odd years of Chicano politics in the United States.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, at least as far as the northern half of South America is concerned (the Andean Region), Mestizo also points ONLY to the people of Indigenous and European ancestry. Somehow I don’t think places like Peru or Argentina are going to be inclusive of a black narrative in the Mestizo identity either given history and ethnoracial composition of Latinidad the farther south you go in South America. Can’t speak on Central America because I haven’t the slightest.</p>
<p>Mestizaje ideology as it’s being developed by contemporary scholars is to include the Afrolatino roots of many of our cultures at peoples.</p>
<p>But Mestizo itself by and large is not a tri-racial term as standard, it does not point to the same vague combination that is undefined as Mixed is in the Anglophone sphere. Mestizo points to a specific combination, on that excludes Blackness and became popular in the US BECAUSE of it’s anti-blackness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great add-on! We can talk for DAYYS about the exclusivity of the African diaspora in the formation of Meatizaje</p>
<p>It’s literally what makes me hate it so fucking much. When I was in high school I would read these Chicano texts and think…wait? Where do I fit in this?</p>
<p><br />But Mestizaje and Mulatez in the Caribbean have similar functions as idealizing us Latinos and Latin Americans as mixed-race people.</p>
<p>When, that’s not the case for all of us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I’ve gotten older I’ve come to realize that, in the Caribbean (and elsewhere), “we’re all mixed” is all-too-often just the Latin version of “I don’t see color.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>^Yes omfg</p>

<p>alsooooo<br /><br />the other other thing that is interesting about this is the way that this also forgets that Filipin@s exist<br /><br />and we are also colonized by spain and have a lot of the same racial categories and concepts. <br /><br />mestis@ is a thing for us too.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t think this forgets filipin@s exist. I think it&#8217;s a perfect add on to what I wrote though. But I was mostly talking as a caribeño on the specifics of the Caribbean. I appreciate that you were able to note that the same mechanism that prides Latin American&#8217;s &#8220;mixed&#8221; ideology works for Filipin@s too.</p></blockquote>

you're quite right

sorry for the inappropriate wording. since my real goal was to note that the mestis@ logic goes into asia via the PH as well.

sorry.
