question: Would Indians and middle eastern people fit into "yellow"

answer: <p><a class="tumblr_blog" href="http://mxb.ca/post/105014322064/would-indians-and-middle-eastern-people-fit-into">mxbees</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>yes.Â </p>
<p>way back when&#8230; before the US reclassified the middle east as &#8216;white&#8217;</p>
<p>they are still part of Asia.</p>
<p>and they def. were considered to be part of the &#8216;yellow&#8217; race by white scientists/anthros/etc.</p></blockquote><p><p>someone on twitter reminded me that <br/><br/>Indians and Middle Eastern ppl were considered 'caucasian' from at least an ethno-linguistic perspective<br/><br/>(still non-white though)</p></p>
