question: Can u explain "gay/bi people havent always existed" ???

answer: <p><a class="tumblr_blog" href="http://medicine.tumblr.com/post/117902446144/can-u-explain-gaybi-people-havent-always">medicine</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Those identities (as well as “straight”) formed through social relations that haven’t always been present in history. <a href="http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic464958.files/DEmilio%20Capitalism%20and%20Gay%20Identity.pdf">This is a great read</a> by john d’emilio on that but it isn’t the only one. I like it because it pieces together how colonialism and capitalism have interacted wrt sexual identities. Here’s a good quote from it:</p><p>“<i>I want to argue that gay men and lesbians have not always existed. Instead, they are a product of history and have come into existence in a specific historical era. Their emergence is associated with the relations of capitalism; it has been the historical development of capitalism – more specifically, its free labor system – that has allowed large numbers of men and women in the late twentieth century to call themselves gay, to see themselves as part of a community of similar men and women, and to organize politically on the basis of that identity.</i>”<br /></p></blockquote><p>like ppl always think i'm lying when i say that sexuality as a distinct identity is only about 40-50 years old. 

that both within and out of the community prior to 1971, sexuality and gender were always intimately connected.

that gay and lesbian history starts in 1971 when they kicked sylvia rivera out of the gay liberation front/gay activists alliance out of a bid for respectability 

gay and lesbian as identity distinct from gender starts at this historical moment when homonationalism is borne. 

and then they create this narrative that sexuality has always been distinct from gender and that gays and lesbians have always existed

and so twoc become an aberration and the foil for the homonationalist gay rights movement. </p>
