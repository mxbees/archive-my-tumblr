question: "i won't say what word she was harassed for" it was hella, literally that was the only time that happened over some AAVE word. Someone called 'Hella' AAVE and then she and the person who sent her the ask agreed it was not AAVE. You are leveling some serious abusive accusations against a trans lesbian latina. The only other time there was any kind of Black discussion on their blog was over afrofuturism versus afropessism. There was no AAVE call out post stop lying.

<p>I actually.  um didn't read that far. </p><p>I think the most amusing thing about this is that I *know* the person who called her out. this literally is the only way it would've ended up on my dash.</p>
