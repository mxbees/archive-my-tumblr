question: hi, i just read your post about rhetorical questions for white people, and you mentioned not getting tattoos as one of the ways to check anti-racist behavior. is that referring to all tattoos, or just tattoos portraying something that is part of a non-white culture? i'm a white passing jew and i was thinking of getting a tattoo at some point  but i don't want to if it's inappropriate for me to do so. (it would probably be in hebrew since it's culturally significant to me, if that matters)

<p>But no. You are too busy getting sailor tattoos without realizing what it even means that sailor tattoos were a thing. How sailors and their tattoos and all the ‘nostalgic’ shit going along with it represents the beginning of american imperialism and shit. how during this period of awesome sailor tattoos america was occupying the Philippines and other Pacific Islands and their sailors were getting tattoos as a way of marking their complicity with this.</p>

<p>Wow. A lot of people in the queer community (at least, where I first joined it) get sailor tattoos and I have literally never heard this talked about.</p></blockquote>

<p>ppl in the queer community getting tattoos is a great example of a group of ppl who get tattooos to mark themselves as 'other', as a way to designate themselves as 'counter-culture'<br/><br/>but of course<br/><br/>the only reason tattoos have this meaning in the white tattooing culture is bc of its origin with iaopoc<br/><br/>sailors and labourers used to get it to mark in-group vs. out-group membership<br/><br/>then white middle class ppl got into it _because_ these associations made getting a tattoo 'rebellious'<br/><br/>and this is why tattoos remain a marker for many different white counter-cultures. <br/><br/>see also: hipsters, punks, goths, ~radical~ queers, skinheads, body mod communities themselves, etc and so on.<br/><br/>i truly think that the only way that tattooing (and other body mods) will ever become truly mainstream is if they become so divorced not only of their origins but from their historical associations with low-brow white groups. <br/><br/>but i actually think that white ppl _like_ having them be markers of rebellion/counter-culture membership bc it helps feel like individuals or whatever the fuck. </p>
