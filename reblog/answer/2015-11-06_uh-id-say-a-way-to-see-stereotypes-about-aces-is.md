question: uh i'd say a way to see stereotypes about aces is to see which characters get headcanoned as ace the most ? (so mostly by people ace themselves but not only). i prefer to stay out of fandom stuff but i've seen  mainly white cis men who are 'intelligent' (whatever that means) and are kind of loners ? also maybe cold-hearted and with next to no romantical experience ?

<blockquote><p>hmmm….  yes. i guess this would make sense.</p><p>i don’t usually pay attention to that side of fandom either (unless it shows up in fic). and i do know that i’ve had some issues with how i’ve seen the occassional character written as ace.</p><p>(i literally think in every single case the character has been sex-repulsed. which fine, that’s a thing. but… some of us do enjoy sex.)</p></blockquote><p>Honestly the only characters I’ve seen headcanoned as ace have been Black, usually Black women, in order to take them out of a romantic equation for the “pure” white character. I think this speaks more to antiblack misogyny and antiblackness than anything.</p></blockquote>
<p>this is interesting. by 'interesting' i mean shitty.<br/><br/>i don't think any of the fandoms i used to be in regularly head-cannoned anyone as ace. so i'm totally willing to take your word for this.</p>
