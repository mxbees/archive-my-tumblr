question: what was the issue of methodology with the clueless whites discussing the history of eugenics? no shade, genuinely curious

answer: <p><a href="http://hoodoodyke.tumblr.com/post/139107507964/what-was-the-issue-of-methodology-with-the" class="tumblr_blog">hoodoodyke</a>:</p><blockquote><p><a class="tumblr_blog" href="http://mxb.ca/post/139107270679/what-was-the-issue-of-methodology-with-the">mxbees</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>my main issue is that the OP presents this as some sort of novel problem, the fact that disabled ppl are a target of eugenics and no one caring. </p>

<p>but also that they think that disability is the only grounds for contemporary eugenics that ppl will defend and think is totally okay.</p>

<p>it isn’t.</p>

<p>white ppl regularly advocate eugenics against ppl of colour and most of them don’t even notice and, honestly, it is often celebrated in certain circles. but most especially *liberal* or left ones.</p></blockquote>
<p>See also:<br>Let’s mix race away!<br>Black people are so ghetto- someone teach them how to stop being thugs and baby mommas and having kids on welfare and committing crimes all the time<br>Asian people are so backwards, they need to be civilized<br>Native Americans are savage, they need to be taught how to behave like actual human beings and quit mooching off the system<br>In fact, you’ll notice the main argument amongst well-meaning liberal whites and their “benevolent racism” involves an eradication of different cultures, specifically cultures that belong to any and all people of color<br><br>The argument for eugenics is not limited to just the elimination of babies being born and growing into the adults that whites despise, but also the annihilation of any culture but what adheres to the standards of white supremacy/whiteness.<br><br>White people of (almost, depending on the area) any ethnicity have the opportunity to have their heritages, their traditions and cultures praised and hailed as something to be protected.<br><br>People of color are not valued in that same way- the very act of racism espouses that we are NOT to be protected, but rather protected from- especially when you’re Black.<br><br>Likewise, whites saying they couldn’t have a baby of a another race is another part of eugenics, but the part I personally want to focus on in this category would definitely be the “mixed babies will save the planet” ideology.<br><br></p>
<p>And, of course, there’s that whole thing whites love to do with genocide. They love to practice it on Black people first, before moving on to other races/white ethnicities. </p>
<p>Advocating to block PoC from entering into “their” countries when the alternative is death. </p>
<p>Creating entire standards of “mixing away” the non-white blood (one drop rule, the genocide against Australian Aboriginals).</p>
<p>Forced sterilization. </p>
<p>Side note:</p>
<p>This has been internalized by non-Black PoC to the point where you have issues like the Cherokee Freedman.</p>

in case anyone was wondering? 

the 'lets mix race away' thing is exactly what i was talking about when i mentioned eugenics supported by liberals, because most conservatives are against racial mixing.

but white liberal love to say that we should 'solve' racism by fucking them and having mixed-with-white-babies.
