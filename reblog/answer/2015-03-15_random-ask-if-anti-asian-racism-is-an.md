question: random ask: If "anti Asian racism" is an appropriation of the term "antiblack racism" and if Orientalism if a specific framework that doesn't just apply to Asia (i.e. North Africa), what do you generally call oppression of /racism against Asians? Actually now that I think about it, Idk if there's also a specific term for indigenous ppl either.... Or are there and I just don't know of them?

answer: <p><a class="tumblr_blog" href="http://mxb.ca/post/113731110194/random-ask-if-anti-asian-racism-is-an">mxbees</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>i’m not entirely clear why everyone needs their own </p><p>asians experience racism. that’s enough, i think.</p></blockquote><p>i didn't mean to be so curt.

but i do find myself puzzled by this ask and the attitude i see in a lot of other asians on this topic.

our racialization as asians is all the 'uniqueness' we need when discussing our experiences under white supremacy

this all feels too much like 'Black ppl think they are so special with getting to name their unique experiences as 'anti-Blackness' but what about me???'

like. just bc Black ppl have a thing, we must have it too. 

bc the ancestors forbid that there is actually something unique and defining about Black ppl's experiences in white supremacy that no one else experiences.

idk. 

i'm off my meds and everything is spinning  </p>
