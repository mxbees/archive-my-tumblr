question: I apologize if you've explained this before but what does MOGII stand for? I've never heard of that acronym for the non cishet community. I'm only familiar with LGBTQIAP+ and GSRM

answer: <p><a href="http://sootonthecarpet.tumblr.com/post/86316163496/i-apologize-if-youve-explained-this-before-but-what" class="tumblr_blog">sootonthecarpet</a>:</p>

<p>reblogging again ‘cause I forgot this morning whether we’d settled with MOGAI or MOGII</p>

<p>but really.<a href="http://b.binaohan.org/?p=3501"> fuck ur umbrella</a>:</p><blockquote><p><a class="tumblr_blog" href="http://genderpunkrock.tumblr.com/post/85353614644/i-apologize-if-youve-explained-this-before-but">genderpunkrock</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>There’s a little backstory here. Take a seat, grab a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>LGBT(QIAP)+, as you probably realize, is long, unwieldy, and often leaves marginalized peoples out. It also tends to fetishize the L, prioritize the G, criticize the B and forget the T+.</p>
<p>An alternative, GS®M was proposed. Proposed in 1966, it stood for Gender, Sexuality (and Romantic) Minorities, and it seemed like a great fit! Until people learned that it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_minority">coined by a pedophile</a>, who also wanted to include cishet kinksters, pedophiles, and even rapists in the acronym, as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_and/or_sexual_minority#Criticism_of_the_term">other criticisms</a> of the acronym itself. So that was obviously out of the question.</p>
<p>Then MOGII came along, but that one had some evolution. The original term was MOGA, for “Marginalized Orientation and Gender Alignments”. That was cool, but then people began to use <a href="http://genderpunkrock.tumblr.com/post/83943076212/queermisandrist-ok-so-the-term-mogai-is-cool">MOGAI</a> to include intersex folks who are often left out of important discussions (MOGA… and Intersex). Then it was pointed out that the “A” was somewhat unnecessary and allowed shitty allies a way to weasel themselves in. So, <a href="http://genderpunkrock.tumblr.com/post/83943076212/queermisandrist-ok-so-the-term-mogai-is-cool">MOGII</a> was born. MOGII stands for Marginalized Orientations, Gender Identity, and Intersex. It’s an excellent catch-all, uses no reclaimed slurs, and makes it entirely about the minorities.</p></blockquote><p>i hate mogai bc from everything i can see, this is a push for greater inclusivity focused on recently surfacing identities (i’m not going to say ‘new’ bc they aren’t new, just new words for existent identities).</p><p>one thing i didn’t see in the tumblr tag is ANY SINGLE person who was advocating for ‘mogai’ saying anything at all about centering twoc. or about making sure that ‘mogai’ is actually a conceptually safe space for us.</p><p>i want to know: any of the ppl currently advocating for this umbrella term:</p><ul><li>what are u doing for incarcerated trans women?</li><li>what are u doing to stop the murder of Black and/or Latina trans women in the US? or of twoc globally?</li><li>what r u doing to support twoc sex workers?</li></ul><p>if ur answer is ‘nothing’ and if u haven’t once even thought about this in conceptualizing this new umbrella</p></blockquote>
