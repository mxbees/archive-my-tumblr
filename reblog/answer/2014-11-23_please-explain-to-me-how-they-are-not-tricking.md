question: Please explain to me how they are not tricking someone? Honestly I just want to hear from your perspective because I'm a cis hetero woman and don't have personal experience on the topic.  I wouldn't necessarily use "tricking" to describe it but they are not being truly truthful so there is a level of dishonesty in their failure to disclose their transition correct?
