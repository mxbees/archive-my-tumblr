question: You should make this blog more public. Provide photos or some other visual proof that these people exist. I was about to pay harmonys phone bill in full but I could not find a single thing on her which makes me think it's just a money begging blog.

answer: <p><a class="tumblr_blog" href="https://www.tumblr.com/blog/private_230185226?119546265682"></a>:</p>

I would consider donating to any of the other posts on this blog if at all possible if you feel comfortable doing so.</p></blockquote><p>what an incredibly fucked up thing to send.

'prove to me that these twoc exist!'

it is particularly awful considering that Harmony is actually a public person.

but also a trans afro-latina who has to deal with and navigate the hypervisibility that goes with it. 

this isn't a person that gives a single fuck about helping twoc. not unless we perform as the perfectly vulnerable victim. 

how exposed and ~public~ must Harmony be before she 'deserves' help?

how much must her body/mind/soul be consumed before you'll consider her worthy?

ugh.

disgusting.</p>
