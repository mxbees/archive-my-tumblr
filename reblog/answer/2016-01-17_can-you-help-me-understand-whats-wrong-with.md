question: can you help me understand what's wrong with darkmatter? i'm not a stan but i've liked what i've read/heard of them so far. i've only heard on tumblr that they are problematic/antiblack but i can't find receipts (i just find things about the universe... lol). thank you! whether you have the capacity to respond or not, thank you for your blog. i've learned so much :)
