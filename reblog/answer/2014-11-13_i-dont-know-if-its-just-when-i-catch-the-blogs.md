question: I don't know if it's just when I catch the blog's asks, but doesn't it seem like everyone's obsessed with Italians nowdays? It's freakin me out. If it's not that they're opressed,it's that they're denying they're white.

<blockquote><p>Before I started wearing the hijab, I had a bunch of white guys hit on me because they thought I was Italian. According to them, full lips, long dark hair, light olive skin &amp; brown eyes are “Italian” features. Mind you, with my hijab almost no one gets my race wrong. I am definitely not white passing.</p>
<p><strong>I don’t deny they are white.</strong> I merely argue that they definitely benefit from white privilege even when they don’t “look” white. I’ll post pictures of an Italian actor &amp; a Pakistani actor to prove my point:</p>

<p><strike>guess who gets to take the racist white girl home?</strike></p>
<p>I’ve met Italians who look really Arab/Pakistani. I’ve also met white girls who refuse to date outside their race &amp; then end up dating a brown-passing Italian man. In fact, the phrase “tall, dark &amp; handsome” commonly used in shitty romance novels written by middle-aged white women almost always exclusively refers to Italian men. <strong>In other words, brown men aren’t attractive but brown-passing white men are.</strong> If this isn’t blatant proof of racism &amp; white supremacy…I don’t know what is. </p>
<p>I don’t think everyone’s obsessed with Italians. I suggest you check this out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia</p>
<p>&amp; who claimed that Italian people are oppressed?! I don’t remember seeing that on our blog O_o</p>
<p>-<span>♏</span></p></blockquote><p><p>italians (and this post) are a great example for why ~whiteness~ is about more than just skin colour<br/><br/>like.<br/><br/>italy had colonies<br/><br/>this means that they are part of the europe that helped define what _white_ is. they are literally the whitest of white ppl. <br/><br/>similar things are said about spaniards and the portugueses<br/><br/>esp. since when they settled in the US they experience some level of ethnic discrimination from nothern/western europeans and their descendants<br/><br/>my principle of<br/><br/>"if u are a european country and you had colonies, then ur fuck WHITE WHITE WHITE"<br/><br/>i don't give a fuck how poorly you might have been treated (or are currently treated) by other white ppl<br/><br/>u participated in the creation of global white supremacy, so ur fucking white.<br/><br/>end of story<br/><br/>(note: i'm not reacting to any thing that op said, this is just something that gets me going)</p></p>
