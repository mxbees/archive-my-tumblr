question: I'm pretty sure some black trans women would be celebrating if a black man goes to prison for transphobic crimes.

<blockquote><p>what is ur point? </p>

<p>are u actually a Black Trans woman? bc if ur not and ur trying to speak on their behalf…. </p>

<p>you’ll note that I was addressing white trans women. </p>

<p>white. trans. women. </p>

<p>however Black trans women feel about the incarceration of Black men is their business, not mine.</p></blockquote><p>Because Black t girls still don&rsquo;t exist beyond political trump cards like this is Yugioh or some shit. We don&rsquo;t exist until someone needs to cite us to shut someone else up.</p></blockquote>

<p>ugh. yes.</p>
