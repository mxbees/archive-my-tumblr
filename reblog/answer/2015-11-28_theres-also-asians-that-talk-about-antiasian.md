<blockquote><p>i honestly don’t care.</p><p>that post, believe or not, was actually about the (non-Black) Asians who cannot seem to talk about our oppression under white supremacy without being anti-Black.</p><p>anyway. i encourage any person who feels compelled to respond like this to that post, to take some time to examine why they think i’m talking about them.</p></blockquote>
<p>i love how this post is already anti-Black by acting like “anti-Asianness” is a real thing that wasn’t just stolen off anti-Black discourse</p>
<p>that’s my favorite part</p>
