question: As a mixed with white person (Chinese-European) I would like to know if my white side gives me more privileges as opposed to a poc-poc mixed person. I don't look white and many people assume I am 100% poc, and as my father is Chinese I carry his last name. I am not trying to 'centralize myself in every fucking thing' but bc I don't know any poc-white or poc-poc mixed people I want to understand how mixed people like myself exclude poc-poc mixed people. Bc no shit poc-poc mixed are fucking mixed.

<p><span>Same mixed white person here, I understand that it’s not your job to educate me but I’ve found that there’s a serious lack of information on the internet regarding this topic therefore I thought it would be best to ask the person who added to the ‘to mixed people’ post. I’m not trying to shove my mixed whiteness into the ‘discussion’ however I would like to understand.</span></p>

<p><span>first of all, be honest. your mixed with white ass *is* shoving your mixed white ass into this discussion by 1) identifying yourself as part white and 2) taking up space in my life to ask me a simple question, and 3) instead of asking how you can support mixed POC-POC, you rather me tell you if you’re privileged when I don’t even know you. but before i get into that..</span></p>
<p>Below is a Google screenshot for the first images of “interracial”. 12/15 pictures are images of white-Black relationships. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Got-Fever-J-C-Davies/dp/0982728409">This includes the fetishization by that “I got the FEVER” white woman who’s fucking disgusting.</a></p>

<p>This second screenshot is one for “Mixed people.” The accompanying categories are “Look White”, “Black And White”, “Blue Eyes”, “Blonde Hair”, and “Hair”. all of these are centered on being mixed with white folks*. Even the “Hair” one shows Black women/girls with looser curls.</p>

<p>Let’s look at this <a href="http://proof.nationalgeographic.com/2013/09/17/visualizing-change/">National Geographic article (x)</a> that features 7 mixed folks, 4 of which are white-POC. there’s 2 that’s mixed POC-POC, and one that’s “biracial” with a sole identity of Black. But you can see how light-skinned all of these people are with (arguably) the exception of the Black-Mexican child.</p>
<p>That’s giving you the context that the current framing of “mixed” or “biracial” is heavily equated with white and POC. My friend also made mixed-race zines back in the 2000&#8217;s and one of my critiques was about how there were very few mixed POC-POC narratives, and how much conversations (on Tumblr, Facebook groups, and conferences/meeting spaces, personal conversations, etc) are centered on mixed white-POC folks being like, &#8220;no one reads me as POC!&#8221; &#8220;I get erased *all* the time!&#8221; It&#8217;s like i don&#8217;t exist!!&#8221; and it&#8217;s like, yes, that invisibility sucks but because of that you get to avoid racial profiling! you don&#8217;t get murdered or killed or arrested like dark-skinned and/or Black mixed folks do!</p>
<p>so basically, like the images from Google and that National Geographic article show, is that we&#8217;re mixing in a way that we will become lighter. not just in skin tone, but hair color and eye color as well. that we&#8217;ll just continue fucking white people until they bleach us of our beautiful dark features and ignore how many Brown and Black folks make babies together and retain dark skin and non-white features. (like, do Afro-Latin@s not exist?? Or all the Chinese people who migrated to Mexico a few generations ago who have children with Mexicans? like..???? we&#8217;ve been mixing without white folks but somehow it&#8217;s newsworthy now for some reason i don&#8217;t understand)</p>
<p>Now to answer your question if you&#8217;re privileged or not, that&#8217;s not really my place to tell you. i don&#8217;t know you, and i&#8217;d appreciate a tip for the knowledge that i just dropped you. you can find a donate button on the side of my blog.</p>
<p>[*I do want to note that blonde hair, red hair, blue/green eyes, etc are not *specifically* white-only features, though racial constructs have shaped them as being white-only features. There’s another <a href="http://artemis-devotee.tumblr.com/post/94551892003/carry-on-my-wayward-butt-but-that-book">Tumblr post here (x) </a>that details natural eye and hair colors that most people assume are only specific to white people.]</p>
<p><span>&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3</span><br/><span>Luna</span></p></blockquote><p>here is a great example why i generally refuse to engage in any kind of mixed-race discussions or groups

ppl mixed with white (like me)

end up pulling this shitty entitled garbage all the time.

like that common mixed-with-white whine about "how no one on either of our sides truly thinks we belong" or whatever

but never reallizing just how much fucking _worse_ this is for poc-poc mixed ppl. 

THIS IS ESP. true for Black ppl

like....

there is a whole fucking _history_ to this stuff 

but we just expect poc-poc mixed or 'monoracial' poc to dry our 

sad little i'm mixed with white tears

bc we're entitled like this</p>
