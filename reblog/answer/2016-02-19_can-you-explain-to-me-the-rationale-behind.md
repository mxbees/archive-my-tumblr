question: Can you explain to me the rationale behind "educate yourself"? This frame of mind has always annoyed me as a person who respects the power of knowledge and teaching others. I don't believe learning comes from just listening to the right people and agreeing with what they say. If people go out to "educate themselves" do you really expect them to think uncritically about things such as Critical Race Theory?

<blockquote><p>Yes, I can explain to you several different rationales behind “educate yourself”.<br/><br/>No, I do not expect them to do so.</p><p>If they were to be thinking uncritically about Critical Race theory, they wouldn’t be educating themselves, now, would they?</p><p>Now that I have answered the two questions you asked, I am going to point out three things to you:</p><p>1 - What I can do and what I am willing to do are two different things.</p><p>2 - Given a few minutes to look through your blog, and noting it matches the same sort of issues as many others here, what a lot of folks on tumblr think of as “critical” is really just being a twit about it. I can count on both hands the number of times I have seen Critical Theory employed on this site. So, while I don’t expect them to think uncritically, I do expect them to learn how to fucking think critically first, because far too few really do, and far too many think they do when they don’t.</p><p>3 - Educate yourself is more than just going off and learning things by yourself &ndash; I mean, we have nearly 4700 years of recorded history and science to duplicate over and over again if one were to do it that way.  The philosophical effort alone is of such a stupendous amount that I dread to think on it. WHen people  say go and educate yourself, they are being gentle &ndash; because almost always it comes down to people not tryign to find out more about critical rac theory, but rather people who want the folks that work on things like critical race theory to work for fucking free.</p><p>They want them to teach, then they should damn well fucking put in the money, time and effort.</p></blockquote><p>
what a strange way to look at 'educate yourself'... 

its a strange notion of education that thinks that dogmatically adhering to whatever ideology or doctrine you encounter actually counts as learning.

as far as i can tell, one of the few things people are generally agreed upon is that there isn't really a consensus in any field. or, rather, the reality of learning is that there are always more things to learn. even in fields where things appear to rely on absolute 'truth' like math or physics, there is still so much we don't know. like... just the other day, didn't some researchers finally observe gratitational fields?

and the further you move away from stuff like that. say to my own field, philosophy, the less certain everything becomes.

one thing that is absolutely fundamental in educating yourself is being open to the very real possibility that you might be wrong. 

for me, one of the greatest joys about learning is, you know, acquiring new knowledge. which often means that whatever i was thinking before was either wrong, inaccurate, incomplete, etc. 

the fact that almost no one agrees on anything and you have to spend time sorting through stuff and making up your own mind about what you think the right theory or whatever the fuck is, this is great!

ppl act like 'educate yourself' is some damning condemnation and the sign of a heartless person. 

i just don't get it.

i love learning. i spend hours everyday educating myself. its a joy for me. 

bleh.</p>
