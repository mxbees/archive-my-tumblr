question: I've seen some dfab individuals IDing as trans women because they're non-binary. What's up with that?

<p>transmisogyny is what is up with that. </p>

<p>coopting of trans women’s narratives is whats up with that. </p>

<p>not sure what else there is to say about this… </p>

<p>i mean. i’ve seen this in the past. and it looks like an easy/fun way to dodge accountability and dilute discourse. </p></blockquote><p>Leslie Feinberg, a beloved icon of so many, was doing this exact thing and even a lot of trans women I know loved her work, and when it became clear after she died that this was going on it really fucked with a lot of people.</p></blockquote>

<p>huh.</p>

<p>so on top of Feinberg being a shitty racist we have this….</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m curious (but not surprised)  abt the racism but yeah. that always irked me about Feinberg</p></blockquote>

<p>from my reading/understanding, her racism is of the... using iaopoc genders (and our narratives) as a way to prop up her ideas and notion of 'transgender warriors' and the whole thing of gender subversion and whatever the fuck.<br/><br/>like we are rhetorical talking points for her gender rebellion despite the fact that many iaopoc genders are communal/collective and community affirming, rather than transgressive. </p>
