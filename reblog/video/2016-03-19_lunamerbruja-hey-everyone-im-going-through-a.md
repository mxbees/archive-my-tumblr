<p><p>Hey everyone! <b>I’m going through a huge life moment and need your support - I’m getting breast augmentation!!</b></p>
<p><i>It’s super vulnerable to be talking about this surgery</i>, especially as a trans woman because often our gender choices are sensationalized and viewed as “cosmetic” rather than affirming. For me, this is the *only* surgery that feels exciting and liberating, so please support me with some donations, share with your networks, and/or feel free to message me with support because I’m totally open to receiving that!</p>

<p>I’m really trusting the universe, faith, and you all to show up as my community and family right now. I’ve never had any type of major surgery before so this is all super exciting and nerve wracking and joyful.</p>
<p><b>Please take some time to <a href="https://www.youcaring.com/lunarchichifund">read the fundraiser (x)</a> for some more info. Thank you so much!</b></p>
<p>all the love &amp; hope,<br>Luna Merbruja</p>
