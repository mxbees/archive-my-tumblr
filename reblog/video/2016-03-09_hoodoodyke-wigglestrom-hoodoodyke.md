<p>what</p>

<p>huh</p>

<p>Is this allowed?</p>

<p>This is… so…. disgustingly racist and orientalist i cannot believe the nerve.<br><br>Why would you- what compels white women to romanticize racialized death?? And to cast Black people to do it (and Naomi girl no- you don’t need that money).<br><br>This white sociopathy. Why are y'all like this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I won’t pretend it’s her realm to insert a performance making that surface level parallel of a love song with racialized-violence-imagery against East Asian folks, but nothing about this video seemed <i>genuinely </i>romantic (nor the song if we go beyond the surface). It was.. painful. <br><br>Whether it’s allowed or not, not for me to say. <br></p>
<p>[EDIT: trigger warnings might have been nice for folks who have been through or touched by that type of violence]<br></p>

<p>“I wanna be the apple of your eye, so drone bomb me.” <br>“Let me be the one you choose [cannot parse auditory]”<br>Using another person’s racialized violence as a metaphor for your own pain is romanticizing and fetishizing their pain as a stand-in for your own. I didn’t use that word lightly, or as a notion of evoking pure, healthy love- I meant it as compelling someone you have (toxic) love for and/or with to destroy you, your life, and your being because of your suffering by using another group of people’s lived and traumatic experiences as your is romanticizing and sociopathic in a white supremacist context.<br><br>Basically, disabled people romanticize our illnesses all the time through more morbid metaphors and this qualifies as one of them- it’s also fucked up, appropriative, and racist.<br><br>When I say “orientalism” I am not talking about East Asia btw- I’m talking about South Asia and the Middle East, who are also subject to orientalism and of which drone imagery is most often evoked. I also mention antiblackness, not just in the context of using Black bodies for this visual metaphor and white supremacy, but also as pointing out African countries being targeted in drone strikes.<br><br></p>
