<p><p><i>am i visibly trans?</i></p>
<p>a free-speak on being a visibly trans person and safety.</p>
<p>Closed-captioning is accurate on YouTube.<br>Transcript:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re like me, and you spend a lot of energy wondering if people know if you’re if trans or not, <b>they do.</b></p>
<p>It’s your voice. It gave you away. It’s your huge nose, or your giant hands, or the way your hips aren’t wide enough, or your body doesn’t curve <i>just enough.</i></p>
<p>It’s your hair, or the way your face is at <i>that</i> certain angle, or the furrow of your brow, the veins in your hands.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that you’re trans. <br>Everyone knows that you’re trans.</p>
<p>And maybe you spend so much energy wondering if anyone knows that you’re trans because you feel scared. Or you feel like, if someone knows <i>that</i> you’ll be in danger or hurt or something. It’s better to assume that you are. That you’re never safe because we are never safe no matter who we’re with or what we look like.</p>
<p>Everyone can read you as cis. People can assume that you have a vagina, assume that you had a cis girlhood, can assume that you have “XX chromosomes” as they would say.</p>
<p>And, you’re still not safe.</p>
<p>Safety, for #girlslikeus, is an illusion. </p>
<p>I assume everyone person I meet knows. And if they don’t, they will.</p>
<p>And that’s okay. I’m not ashamed of that. It makes me a little fearful, but I’ve spent so much energy guessing if people read me as trans or not. If I just assume that I’m visibly trans at all times, I know that my safety is never guaranteed. </p>
<p>And it won’t stop me. I’m still going to continue to live my life ferociously and fearlessly, for 2016 and for the rest of my life.</p>
