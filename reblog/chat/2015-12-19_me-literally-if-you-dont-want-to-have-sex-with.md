Me, literally: If you don't want to have sex with trans women, you don't have to, just please leave us the fuck alone instead of harassing us with your hate boners.
Some apparently illiterate TERF: It sounds like you're trying to coerce me into wanting sex with you. That's rape and you're a rapist.<p>this is literally how every discussion about having sex with trans women goes down.<br/><br/>usually with bonus death threats. </p>
