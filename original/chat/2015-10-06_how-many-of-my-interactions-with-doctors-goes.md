Doctor: So... do you have any health problems?
me: Um, yeah, I have sleep apnea.
Doctor: Do you have a CPAP machine?
me: no, I can't afford one bc i'm poor.
doctor: *purses lips and looks disapproving*
me: ...
doctor: so it looks like ur liver is fat.
me: oh. okay.
doctor: bc this happens to mostly fat ppl and the medical profession doesn't care about fat ppl no one has actually studied this and figured out any treatment for it other than diet and exercise. so. um. maintain a healthy weight and exercise.
me: um... okay? but like. i'm depressed and one of the meds u gave me actually makes me gain weight (or makes it difficult to loose weight). but without the med, i don't get out of bed... much less exercise the recommended 30 minutes a day.
doctor: hmm... maybe we should increase your dosage!
me: um.... okay?
doctor: but the main thing is diet and exercise. try to eat lots of fresh veggies and cut down on sugar, carbs, and fat.
me: did u miss the part where i'm too poor to afford a piece of medical equipment for a condition known to increase my chances of having a fatty liver. what, exactly, makes u think i have the money for a low fat, low carb, low sugar diet with lots of fresh veggies? 
doctor: *shrugs*
me: ...
doctor: ur fat lol
me: >.>
