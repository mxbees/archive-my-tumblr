me: so. i keep shitting blood.

doctor: huh. is ur poop hard when this happens?

me: sometimes, but not always.

doctor: let me stick my finger up ur butt to see if i can find anything. \*sticks finger up my butt and doesn't find anything\* welp, i think its fine.

me: ...

me six months later: so... that whole shitting blood thing is still going on and now my tummy hurts and i'm having trouble eating things

doctor: ok. let's get u a colonscopy to see up ur butt.

me: fine.

colonscopy doctor: so. MR. i didn't see anything so u have IBS.

me: um... but like doesn't EVERY resource on IBS say that blood in your stool is a reason to think it might be something *other* than IBS?

colonscopy doctor: MR, i don't have to answer your questions.

family doctor: ah, IBS just like i thought.

me: \*months later and i'm still shitting blood periodically but comforted by the fact that apparently this is fine. everything is fine.\*
