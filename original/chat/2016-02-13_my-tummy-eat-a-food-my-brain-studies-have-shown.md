my tummy: eat a food
my brain: studies have shown that eating a food is a leading cause of death.
my tummy: stop making excuses and eat a food now.
my brain: ur not the boss of me. i do what i want.
my tummy: *screams for a thousand years*
my brain: *covers ears and sings 'La La La I can't hear you'*
