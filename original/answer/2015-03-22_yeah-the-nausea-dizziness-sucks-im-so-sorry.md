question: yeah the nausea / dizziness sucks :( im so sorry you're having to go through that! what really helped those symptoms for me was smoking weed but i don't know if that's an option for you

answer: <p>i do smoke.... but supplies are low and i don’t know where to get a steady/reliable source, so i’m mostly conserving it for when things get really bad with my anxiety since i also can’t drink atm.</p>
