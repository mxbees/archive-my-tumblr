question: lol i'm southeast european and s/e european ppl on tumblr are bad with the "we're oppressed, we aren't white!" thing. like, when we get the hordes of neo-nazis and white supremacists out of our countries maybe i'll take them seriously... it's true that we are treated badly by west european people sometimes though.

answer: <p>sure of course it is. i mean... nordicism is a real thing that still influences a lot of how different euros interact with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>the thing that always gets me is ppl like the spanish or portuguese who think this is the same as the white supremacy they helped created. when it really really isnâ€™t.</p>
