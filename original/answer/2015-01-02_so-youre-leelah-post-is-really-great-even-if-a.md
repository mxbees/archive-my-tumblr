question: So you're Leelah post is really great (even if a compilation of what others have been saying for so long, having it all right together is so important), but you had one line that really threw me. It wasn't about her, it was "It is these same toxic elements of sexism that lead so many girls to develop eating disorders." It feels weird to me (as someone with an ED) to mention sexism = EDs without elaboration, bc it kind of reinforces "EDs are about appearance" which they're not. (1)

answer: <p>&gt;<span>(2) so I just wanted to ask if you'd be willing to either add more info/links to how sexism relates to EDs but that doesn't mean EDs are about appearance, or maybe just reword it to being about insecurities instead of specifically eating disorders? I know this was not at all a main/important part of the post, it just stuck with me for personal reasons so I figured I would at least ask.</span></p>
<p>you're right that EDs aren't necessarily about appearance.</p>
<p>for this post, i was speaking from my own experience with having an ED which was very much about internalized fatphobia and cisnormative (and white supremacist) standards of beauty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>but it was also somewhat linked to my social phobia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>while sexism and normative standards of beauty aren't the sole cause of harmful eating behaviours in girls, they can be a motivation. they were for me.</p>
<p>and you're right to chastise me for simplifying this complex issue, i'm sorry for that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i'm not sure i'll reword it because, as noted earlier in the post, the entire thing is framed around my personal experiences. I'll add another footnote, though, to note that it is my personal experiences with EDs that i'm referrencing.</p>
