question: thank you very much (and there's nothing to forgive because i know you're speaking from the heart). i put it in quotes because i know there's no real metric but i'm still learning not to minimize my own experiences or compare my situation to people around me /*while*/ trying to help my mom and sisters realize that the way she/we grew up was Not Normal and not OK and like... baby steps. I'm learning that inching towards recovery is better than nothing, y'know?

answer: <p>*nods* <br></p><p>it is a really really hard process. <br></p><p>mostly, i really just wanted to validate you and your experiences, bc one of the things about abuse that has become normalized in your life, is that you really do doubt yourself and how you understand your experiences. it doesn’t help that a lot of media and pop culture will re-enforce abuse culture and try to communicate that ‘no, it was fine’.</p><p>in any case: i wish you the best of luck in your journey to healing. i hope you find the resources you need and any support you might want.<br></p>
