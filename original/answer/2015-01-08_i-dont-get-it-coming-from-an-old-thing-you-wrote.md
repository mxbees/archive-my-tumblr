question: I don't get it. Coming from an old thing you wrote on Klain fanfic: how could Blaine be regularly coded as non-white in 1930s or w/e time period? Maybe I just really suck at faces (and yeah, I kind of do...). I just don't see how he could be seen as anything but white. Okay I really suck at faces, I do. Maybe the standards of whiteness were just really strong back then and everybody had sharp radars? How do face recognize.

answer: <p>omg. i forgot about this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>there are a few layers here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>bc it isn't just about his face... like it is part of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>one of the few historically accurate or sensible fics i've seen with Blaine as not-white but coding as white is one where he is specifically passing as white. which, historically (and esp. of the 30s or whatever) is something that happened with light skinned Black ppl. this is where the whole concept of racial passing comes from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i'm also partially basing this on my own experience as a mixed-with-white pinay who can be coded as white (and was frequently coded this way in one of the cities i lived in). when i lived in a majority white place? i _never_ coded as white.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ppl, esp, in fic like to compare Blain to old (white) movie stars which i find hilarious bc movie stars from the 30s/40s/50s embodied a very _different_ type of 'masculine' aesthetic than is popular today. like. &nbsp;have u actually seen a picture of Rock Hudson or Cary Grant?&nbsp;</p>
<p>my guess (and of course this can only be a guess) is that Blaine _could_ pass as white, but it would have to be a conscious decision for him to do so. and if he did, his best bet would be to claim southern european heritage, which would have made him white but subject to the ethnic discrimination that southern europeans experienced at that time. which was still better than what Asians dealt with (and significantly better than what Black ppl dealt with).</p>
<p>but passing himself off as southern european would likely mean that he would have the class privilege most historical fic writers like to give to him. bc of the discrimination.</p>
