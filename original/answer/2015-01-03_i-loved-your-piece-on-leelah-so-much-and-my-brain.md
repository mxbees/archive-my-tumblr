question: I loved your piece on Leelah so much and my brain is on fucking fire right now.  The whole discourse around Leelah's death has bothered the fuck out of me.  It's The Matrix "you sense something is wrong but you don't know what it is..."  You've brought form to what I was sensing.  Thank you so much.

answer: <p>you're welcome.</p>
<p>i wrote the piece, in part, because i was starting to feel crazy with all the stuff i noticed about the reactions but that few other people were.&nbsp;</p>
<p>it has been pretty affirming for me to know that others were seeing some of the same things to (even if they weren't able to fully articulate them)</p>
