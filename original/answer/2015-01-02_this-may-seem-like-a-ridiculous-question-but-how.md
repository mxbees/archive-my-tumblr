question: this may seem like a ridiculous question, but. how do i follow you? i've seen your amazing posts over more than a few months on here and i've wanted to follow you so badly, but there's no follow button. if you don't want more followers, how do i reblog straight from you? i'm trying to surround myself on here with other woc, because admittedly, i have very little contact with woc and i want to better educate myself on our politics.

answer: <p>umm.... u can follow me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i just switched on the tumblr feature for 'promoting' it. so if u go on to the page &nbsp;you should see a follow button on the top right corner now.</p>
<p>i know there are other ways to do it from the dash, but i can't remember what they are rn.</p>
