question: i was under the impression that indigenous meant any populations in the americas before european colonialism and am unsure if you're saying that black people were a part of this population or if my understanding of what the identity "indigenous" constitutes should be expanded to include some (all?) black populations in the americas? in any case, i would also like to read more about this.

answer: <p>indigenous doesn’t just refer to people of the americas before colonialism. there are Indigenous ppls all over the world. moreover... who is&nbsp;‘Indigenous’ often depends on specific contexts.&nbsp;</p><p>in the philippines, for example, while technically all the various ethnics groups (other than late comers like the Chinese) can be considered indigenous, it is usually the smaller, marginalized ethnic groups who’ve retain a lot more of their pre-colonial traditions that are considered indigenous (like the Kalinga or Aeta).</p><p>i don’t really have any resources. i mean. i learn about this stuff from listening to friends and other ppl on twitter/tumblr/etc.&nbsp;</p>
