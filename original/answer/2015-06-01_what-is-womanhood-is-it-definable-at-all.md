question: What is womanhood? Is it definable at all?

answer: <p>the answer to this sort of depends on what you mean by&nbsp;‘definable’.</p><p>womanhood is something women experience.&nbsp;</p><p>this is one definition. perhaps not the most satisfying one, but perhaps the most accurate and expansive one.</p><p>defining&nbsp;‘womanhood’ largely depends on defining&nbsp;‘woman’.&nbsp;</p><p>and this leads us into a different set of questions.&nbsp;</p>
