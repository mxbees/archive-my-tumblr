question: Your recent tweets are confusing me a bit. Are you trying to argue that black ppl are indigenous to America?

answer: <p>the framing of this question troubles me. since iâ€™m not trying to argue anything. some Black ppl are Indigenous to the americas. this is a fact. what i was really discussing is the way that some nonBlack Indigenous ppl in the americas seem unwilling to recognize this fact by always defining Indigeneity in the americas as always excluding Black ppl. that if u are Black u cannot be Indigenous in the americas. which is wrong.<br></p>
