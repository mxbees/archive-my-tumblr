question: Hope this isn't weird, but just chiming in to say that it's actually pretty easy shaving around chest or titty hair. It's around the nipples where it all becomes a problem. Tweezers help then but then that shit HURTS ðŸ˜–

answer: <p>ah. good to know</p><p>like. i still want to get rid of it bc i find shaving irritating. like. i never want to do it. i donâ€™t care if this means i keep the hair or it all has to go away permanently. but... i have too many things to do and not enough energy to do them all to want to waste time/energy on fucking shaving all the time.</p><p>esp. when the body hair is only an issue bc only cis/white women get celebrated for having body hair. the rest of us suffer.</p>
