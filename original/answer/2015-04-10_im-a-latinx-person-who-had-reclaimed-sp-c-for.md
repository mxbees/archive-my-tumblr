question: I'm a Latinx person who had reclaimed sp-c for myself that doesn't mean it isn't a slur still. It's still a term that can and had been used against me. Queer is the same way but white queers don't get that apparently?

answer: <p>nope.</p><p>i mean... iâ€™m also reclaiming ladyboy and, yup, still a fucking slur (a racialized one at that)</p><p>but apparently a bunch of aces are willing to pile up on a twoc for their right to reclaim a slur....</p><p>basically business as usual for teh fucking community</p>
