question: Clarification: I'm not defending cis people who claim they aren't cis so much as I'm wondering what cis even means such that this kind of situation happens in the first place - where cis people are struggling against being designated cis

answer: <p>ah.&nbsp;</p><p>well. the thing is, this isn’t even unique to&nbsp;‘cis’. people of the oppressor category _hate_ being named. this is established.</p><p>like.</p><p>i see white ppl _all the time_ get mad and resistant to being called&nbsp;‘white’. they hate being classified in a racial category. some of them respond that, no, they aren’t white they are irish. or italian. or german. or some other variation of white. but they’ll swear and insist that they aren’t white for whatever reason.&nbsp;</p><p>and. yeah. i’m not talking about genuine edge cases. but like. people who are white and have always been white. unambiguously so.&nbsp;</p><p>white ppl who get fucking _furious_ if you call them white. who will insist that they cannot be so.&nbsp;</p><p>the cis thing only seems more apparent because&nbsp;‘cis’ is newer than&nbsp;‘white’, as far as a way to name your oppressor is concerned. and so certain people are starting to have trouble with it (namely, white gays). but like, white lesbians have been articulating this same criticism against being called&nbsp;‘cis’ for a long time now. at least as long as&nbsp;‘cis’ has been used to name an oppressor class.&nbsp;</p><p>but there isn’t anything new about people used to be unnamed bc they are the&nbsp;‘default’ human getting SUPER MAD about being named.&nbsp;</p>
