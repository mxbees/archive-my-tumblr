question: Honestly, no. It is not only ignorant but sad that you put a singular race to blame at the loss of our fish. As someone who is half-cherokee, my family has been fishing for centuries far behind and we shared with the white men, gave them our tips because we didn't want them to die in the wastelands. Because we are brothers of blood. We help another. Everyone can have fish. It's a matter of food, not of race. Bears and Eagles are both different beings but eat the same fishz because it is nature.

answer: <p>i don’t even know when i got this.</p><p>but...</p><p>i’m guessing ur white bc i don’t believe random anon ppl who claim to be Indigenous. sorry.</p><p>especially not when the point being made is something so clearly absurd.</p>
