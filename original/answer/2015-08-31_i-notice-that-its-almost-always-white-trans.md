question: I notice that it's almost always white trans men/AFAB trans ppl who have issues with anything you say. I'd say that's proof of there being a level of racism to this too in addition to the transmisogyny

answer: <p>yeahhh.</p><p>although. it isn’t entirely accurate bc i’ve had my fair share of disagreements with trans men of colour. <br></p><p>but your point isn’t fairly accurate since my disagreements with trans moc tend to happen with far far less frequency.</p><p>(oh. and re: racism, i definitely have a lot of issues with white trans women too...)<br></p>
