question: I was really nervous leading up to ur last post on domestic violence cause I didn't know what it would be but I think u said really important things and I'm really glad u said it. I feel like nobody cares about domestic violence and I've seen it dismissed as "straight ppl things" several times and it's gross and I've only seen that behaviour called out one other time.

answer: <p>i’m glad my warnings failed to live up to this expectation.</p><p>honestly? my trepidation about posting on this was precisely bc i’ve seen so many conversations and whatever derailed by this.</p><p>and its frustrating to me bc it isn’t even like i do much in meatspace, so the fact that ppl think that teh str8s are taking up too much space when we talk amongst ourselves on tumblr or whatever is really troubling to me.</p><p>also seen some really.... unempathetic responses to ppl seeking support/comfort/help around dating men. it really makes me wonder how much of stifling effect this has on trans women (of colour) who are experiencing domestic violence at the hands of their cis male partners.</p><p>like. i get that there is a whole subset of trans women who are straight and absolutely about stealth, assimilation, and all of that. and that many of these women have been (and are) lesbophobic/homophobic.&nbsp;</p><p>(although, in my experience? this group tends to be white, class privileged women, rather than twoc)</p><p>but yeah. i’m done. this is a line that i’m drawing.</p><p>DV/IPV is a serious fucking problem for twoc. and if ppl can’t see how their cavalier attitudes and dismissal of those of us who date men, helps makes us more vulnerable to it?</p><p>srsly. go away and leave me alone.&nbsp;</p>
