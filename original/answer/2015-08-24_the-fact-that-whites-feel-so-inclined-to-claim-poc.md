question: The fact that whites feel so inclined to claim PoC as their ancestors just WREAKS of neo-colonialism to me.  Without QTPoC White queer and trans people would have NOTHING.  It was TWoC who started the pride movement.  It was white people who erased our genders, our cultures, our lifestyles, our LIVES and these audacious, disgusting, pasty-faced motherfuckers have the gall to claim yours and mine dead ancestors as their own??? Fucking despicable

answer: <p>YES EXACTLY</p><p>like. the thing with Storme just strikes me as white lesbians trying to make the claim like we shouldn’t say stonewall was twoc led bc there was a Black lesbian there and i’m like...</p><p>it is still queer women OF COLOUR (women understood in the broadest terms) who started it all. what does this have to do with white ppl? nothing.</p><p>like. white cis lesbians conditionally claiming a Black lesbian in order to make a point? totally neocolonialism.&nbsp;</p>
