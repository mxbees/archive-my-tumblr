question: Thanks for responding. I get very emotionally invested into fictional stories of all sorts and I need spoilers to keep my anxiety from spiking up or I have to literally stop myself and take a deep breath and come back to it later or fast forward to the end.

answer: <p>This is me too. Lol.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m not sure I’d actually recommend either of those books. But they are fairly innocuous stories overall. But if you decide to read the Andrew Grey one, there is a trigger warning for gay bashing (its short and not brutally graphic but it is there and def. reminded me too much of my own mugging).</p><p>This anxiety thing is like, why I’m literally in the middle of 54 books right now. Lol.</p>
