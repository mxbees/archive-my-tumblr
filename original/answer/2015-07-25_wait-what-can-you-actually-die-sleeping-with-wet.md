question: wait what can you actually die sleeping with wet hair

answer: <p>well...</p><p>i mean. it is a filipinx (or maybe just a tagalog) superstition that pretty much everyone in my family believes.</p><p>but... it isn’t a superstition i’ve ever had a desire to test. at best, i’ll take naps with wet hair... but i won’t go to bed with it.&nbsp;</p><p>like. the only ppl in my family who’ll take showers at night are ppl with short hair that’ll dry. and you still need enough time for it to adequately dry. or else....</p><p>not something feasible when you have long hair like i do and it takes like... four hours (or more depending on humidity) to air dry.&nbsp;</p>
