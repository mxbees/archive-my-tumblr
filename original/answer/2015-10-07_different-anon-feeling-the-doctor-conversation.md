question: (different anon) feeling the doctor conversation soo much, im trying to find a doctor rn to get a dx so i can stay on welfare and it's so frustrating and traumatizing, like they just assume right away that a) you're lying or misinformed and b) if u know anything about your own body or disabilities they have to put u back in ur place by denying you care. im so sorry ur going through this crap too!!

answer: <p>omg. i’m trying to get on disability and just starting the process and i’m _really_ not looking forward to dealing with it all. <br></p><p>i’m sorry ur going through this too. <br></p>
