question: Hi. I'm not sure how important this is but on your tumblr not all the tags links show at zoom 100% on with firefox (and windows 8, 1366*768 resolution i think). Changing the position of your 'header' will correct this if you want to (there're two links not showing). Also i really like how big your font is, my eyes thank you. Have a nice day.

answer: <p>this is important, but i’m not quite sure what you mean.&nbsp;</p><p>i know that viewing on chrome, linux, its fine...&nbsp;</p><p>can you tell me which two links aren’t visible? i’ll double check the css and see what might be the problem.</p><p>also... i’m glad that the font size is good! i think that’s one of the first things i change with every theme. increase the font size and ensure that there is high contrast between text and background (usually black text on white).&nbsp;</p>
