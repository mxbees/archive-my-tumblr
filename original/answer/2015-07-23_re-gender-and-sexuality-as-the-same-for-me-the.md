question: RE: gender and sexuality as The Same for me, the bit of context that might like, clarify things is that as well as white, i'm nonwestern (russian) and back in russia, LGBT+ stuff is still in the prestonewall era? very hushhush, very tiptoeing around euphemisms, very The Love That Dares Not Speak Its Name so that's the sort of thing i grew up with before we moved and i still feel like my conception of self is stuck in the era before being "out" in the modern, western sense was possible

answer: <blockquote><p>like, i was very much brought up with the notion that being LGBT+ would make me a completely different type of person entirely separate from cis and straight people; i can talk more about the state of things in russia if you're curious, but keep in mind that i'm an immigrant and haven't been home in 15 years, so it wouldn't be a very good analysis<br></p></blockquote><p>this makes sense to me. i mean. yeah. what you talk about is true in a lot of places where a gay liberation movement hasnâ€™t been systematically seperating gender from sexuality for years as a way to disenfranchise twoc from the movement.&nbsp;</p>
