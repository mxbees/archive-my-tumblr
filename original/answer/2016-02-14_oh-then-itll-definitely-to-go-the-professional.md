question: Oh then it'll definitely to go the professional hair removal way, cause even with wax my chest hair grows back in like 2 weeks tops (with shaving even less) and it's so much work just to avoid any kinda harassment. With legs it's even worse imo.

answer: <p>yeah. its the legs i’m really thinking about.&nbsp;</p><p>but i’m still ambivalent. i mean... i technically don’t *need* to wear skirts/shorts in the summer. and there’s good reasons, beyond hair, why i should (ie, my allergy to the sun).</p><p>it also just occurred to me that i could possibly use the remaining funds to finish getting tattooed, since i consider that an integral part of my&nbsp;‘transition’. like i bet i could get a sleeve on my right arm for that much money....</p>
