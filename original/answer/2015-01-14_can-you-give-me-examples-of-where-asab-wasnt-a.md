question: can you give me examples of where asab wasn't a thing? not trying to prove you wrong i'm a genderescent person looking for history that isn't destroyed by binarist historians

answer: <p>well... ok.</p>
<p>first thing is that the biological notion of 'sex' that currently is used for asab is a fairly new thing. so is the notion of genetics and such that guides the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>these are both important bc they are what create the current system of asab that basically asserts that biology is destiny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>so when we look at examples of culture either before the notion of biological destiny or cultures that resist via indigenous gender systems the idea that biology is destiny we can begin to understand what 'dyadic' sorting of infants could be like without a notion of 'sex' (as biology).</p>
<p>we could see that some cultures sort based on expected gender roles that certain bodies were intended to fulfill. But where, should the body be unsuited for that role, the role can/could change without much fuss. essentially, that you weren't 'locked' into however &nbsp;you might've been sorted at birth. if you were at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>the thing about asab as a current system is that the sex assigned is supposed to be an unchanging aspect of you that allows the state to identify you. much like the year and day that you were born, since that is a temporally bounded incident (it happened that one time and that one time only and it is a way to uniquely identify you within the &nbsp;system).&nbsp;</p>
<p>i guess what i'm saying is that you've framed the question wrong. 'asab' is a specific historical and cultural practice that should not be thought as ahistorical and universal. i mean... can you really say that people have been doing asab (with attendant birth certificates) always and forever and everywhere?</p>
<p>no. you can't. bc it isn't true.&nbsp;</p>
