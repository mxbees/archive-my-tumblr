question: theres also Asians that talk about antiasian racism without being antiblack, because calling out antiasianness even in black communities =/= antiblackness.

answer: <p>i honestly don’t care.</p><p>that post, believe or not, was actually about the (non-Black) Asians who cannot seem to talk about our oppression under white supremacy without being anti-Black.</p><p>anyway. i encourage any person who feels compelled to respond like this to that post, to take some time to examine why they think i’m talking about them.</p>
