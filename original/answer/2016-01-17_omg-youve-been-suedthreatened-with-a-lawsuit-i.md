question: Omg, you've been sued/threatened with a lawsuit, I am so sorry and I love seeing your commentary on things, I wish others weren't so damned bothered by that!

answer: <p>huh. i thought it was common knowledge at this point that my big 2014/2015 drama was being embroiled in a defamation lawsuit... (i mean, details about this really aren’t hard to find).</p><p>amusingly, it was irl me (so to speak) that got sued. for something i wrote in my now defunct professional blog (as in my blog about stuff relating to my now dead career).&nbsp;</p><p>when i talk about how i am unemployable bc i have a garbage professional reputation, this is what i’m talking about.&nbsp;</p>
