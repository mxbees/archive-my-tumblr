question: hello! this is a small thing, but you said in a post a little bit ago that whites "didnâ€™t want to credit Arabic ppl with bringing them out of the dark ages," but no person is Arabic! Arabic is a language, Arab is the term for the ethnicity

answer: <p>this isn't a small thing and thanks for letting me know.</p>
