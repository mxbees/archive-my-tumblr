question: hello!long time follower 1st time asker. I was wondering if u have any thoughts on gender wrt your audio post for PoC of unknown cultural origin? for ex,  I am black american/cape verdean and there is a lot of cultural mixing w/o specificity (cont%)

answer: <blockquote>
<p><span>(%cont) bc of my lack of knowledge of my specific culture, I'm unsure of how my gender can work? like I feel very Un trans and un cis, but I have nothing historical to look back on so I feel very lost? like.... colonialism.... ugh...</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>sorry it has been so long since i answered this...</p>
<p>interestingly... this is the sort of thing that we made <a href="http://genderescent.tumblr.com/">genderescent</a> for... bc, yeah, while i'm super lucky to have cultural/historical roots that i can identify, i know that this isn't true for a lot of ppl</p>
<p>(also... like, the past is good to know, but it was never perfect, so it is good to have a space to discuss and explore and to improve</p>
<p>but i do want to say that ur gender feels are valid. and they are real. ultimately, you are the only person who can really contextualize and articulate what they are... but they are valid.</p>
<p>like...sometimes we can find words in english (for example) that do closely match but we can also shift the meaning to better suit us or make new words entirely. whatever.</p>
<p>idk. i hope this helps.</p>
