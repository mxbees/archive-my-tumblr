question: Hi! I follow and u talk a lot about Blumenbach n how there's 4 races. Ppl in Asia recently told me it works diff there and Chinese, Malay, and Japanese (Yamato) for example are considered diff races. They call Chinese racist towards Malay ppl. Since race is a social construction is it possible they could've made more races? Yamato got it from the Nazis too. I mean...how does this all fit in with your ideas? Are they wrong? Or is it just a different system? Is it compatible with the 4 race thing?

answer: <p>i’ve been mulling over how to answer this question for a while...</p><p>one correction: blumenbach advanced a five race theory, not four.&nbsp;</p><p>honestly? it sort of depends on your framework for understanding what racism is.</p><p>me? i think it is a singular, historically bounded phenomena. what i mean by this, if it isn’t part of the system created by white supremacy from about 1500 until today to essentialise the inferiority of anyone who isn’t white, then it isn’t racism.</p><p>so inter-ethnic conflicts in Asia aren’t racism.</p><p>many people are likely to disagree with me. that’s fine. given that in teh current Discourse, literally anything can be racism....&nbsp;</p>
