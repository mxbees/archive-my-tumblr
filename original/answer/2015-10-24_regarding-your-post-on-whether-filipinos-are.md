question: regarding your post on whether filipinos are asian: race may have been invented by white people for colonization and subjugation of other peoples, but it is not only maintained by them. it is maintained by EVERYONE especially considering colonial mentality/internalized racism. race was once used as a science to legitimize it, but that's it. it's a social construct and therefore propagated by society, not just whites. we brown ppl need to recognize that.

answer: <p>i’m a little conflicted. bc ur partially right and partially wrong.</p><p>we don’t&nbsp;‘maintain’ it since it is a system of oppression and white supremacy. we are not oppressing ourselves. we are also not all equally responsible for the state of racism today.</p><p>suggesting that we are all responsible bc it is a&nbsp;‘social construct’ created by&nbsp;‘society’ is really... at its most basic victim blaming. while, yes, we do need to shoulder some of the burden of what we’ve done and how we’ve harmed ppl... there are limits to this.</p><p>society doesn’t actually maintain racism, that’s white supremacy.</p><p>the part you’re right about, though, is the fact that, yes, one of the ways that the system works is that it forces us to participate in our own (and most especially others) oppression.&nbsp;</p>
