question: circassians(caucasians) were considered the most ethnically pure "whites" by Blumenbach and he theorised the caucasus were where mankind began. Hence the appropriation of the term "caucasian" which is racist outside of  caucasus region

answer: <p>Yup. This is true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nordicism wasn't something he specifically advanced, but these sorts of things (as they were developed in eugenics) were foundational.</p>
<p>Like. 'Caucasian' is still commonly used in NA to refer to white ppl... and like, if you try and tell white people that using 'Caucasian' is actually offensive/racist....</p>
<p>That conversation rarely goes well.&nbsp;</p>
