question: Do you often ostracize people from your following?  Example, I saw that one of your followers reblogged a "Ways to support Trans Visibility Day" post; would you tell said follower that they are worthless and to go fuck themselves?

answer: <p>wtf?</p><p>you get that i don’t follow most of my followers, right?</p><p>i have, actually, very few mutuals.</p><p>more to the point: i don’t monitor or surveil the ppl who folow me bc i’m not responsible for what they do or don’t do.</p><p>in any case, u should go fuck urself for this ridiculous ask. <br></p>
