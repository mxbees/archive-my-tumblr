question: Hey, I'm sorry that you're doing shitty. If your lack of eating was related to finances, can I encourage you to post a fundraiser? But yeah. I'm sorry you are doing badly, and hope that you feel better.

answer: <p>no. not finances. gut problems that've been going on for a while but got really bad this past week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i can't eat a lot of food (both variety and quantity) without feeling sick. and if i do eat too much, i end up pooping blood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks for the well wishes.</p>
