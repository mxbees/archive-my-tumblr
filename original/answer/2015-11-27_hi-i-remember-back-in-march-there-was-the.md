question: hi! i remember back in march there was the promotion for biyuti publishing, and one of the rewards was a print copy of deconstructing whipping girl. is that still a thing? is there any other way to get the book? because the link is still up on biyuti publishing's page, but idk if it's an empty link or if it's still possible to get the book. i've already bought deconstructing trans/gender 101 & i just want to be free and i want to keep supporting u bc yr writing's awesome! thank u!

answer: <p>um.... maybe? i mean. i just finished writing the book a month or so ago. and i’ve been pretty... unmotivated to like start editing it and stuff.&nbsp;</p><p>so. technically, its still unpublished?&nbsp;</p><p>hopefully i’ll find the inspiration to get around to it soon....</p>
