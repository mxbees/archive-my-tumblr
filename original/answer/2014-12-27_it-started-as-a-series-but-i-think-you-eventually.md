question: it started as a series, but i think you eventually compiled it into a longer post.  like, if i remember it might have started as stream of consciousness posting and after a bunch of people reacted to it feeling validated you compiled it into something longer.  i think that it was written with a repeating sentence structure, but i don't remember specific keywords :/

answer: <p>ok! i think it was the abnormal parenting one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i know how to find this all. so. i'll dig it up and repost (since they've all been deleted from my blog)</p>
<p>gimme a second and it'll show up!</p>
