question: The NB PoC anon: I think I understand (& love when you talk abt Chinese stuff cuz I never had chance to learn it). You said PoC might be forced to use colonial language to ID & you said it's diff when a Chinese person using the Chinese binary IDs as binary. But is my IDing as NB (w/ no association or knowledge of indigenous or PoC genders til this year) purely a western construct thats inherently oppositional to my existence? So it makes no sense for me to ID as NB? Sry for so much asking.

answer: <p>not all... re: that IDing as nonbinary (without any knowledge of iaopoc gender stuff) is oppositional to your existence.</p>
<p>like... no. this isn't the right way to think about it.</p>
<p>the first thing to do is to make a distinction between your identity as it is and the words/concepts you use to articulate/express it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>you are who you are. and your gender is your gender. nothing and no one can take this away from you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>you cannot exist in a way that is oppositional to your existence (as in, you can't both be exist and be the negation to your existence -- well... in some belief systems you can but as you mention, assume we are working within a white discursive framework). in logic, this is the law of non-contradiction.</p>
<p>what i'm saying here is that while you might have to use colonial words to describe yourself, your existence is what precedes the words, not the other way around. the words and concepts you use to describe yourself do not shape or change the actual substance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>even those of us lucky enough to have access to specific cultural knowledge about our genders, if we live in the diaspora or don't speak our mother tongues (i can't speak tagalog, only english with any real fluency), have to use colonial languages (and thus the frameworks) to articulate our identities.</p>
<p>generally, for the sake of convenience i use 'nonbinary' to situate myself within white hegemonic gender discourse bc it is, unfortunately, necessary if i want to communicate with others. so, yeah, i do ID as nonbinary. i mean depending on which bio you read of mine, i'll say 'third gender' or some such, which is a white created term that also reifies the white binary. like, yeah, it is partially an act of reclamation for me, but this is an ID term i use for myself. does IDing this way mean that i'm submitting to white supremacy and its desire to name me? no.&nbsp;</p>
<p>a different way you might look at this is the cause and effect angle. the white binary exists bc _you_ exist, not the other way around. your existence is ontologically prior. actually, more importantly you exist but the white binary is a social construction, so IDing yourself as noted elsewhere is an act of agency that the white binary tries to deny you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>this agency includes IDing as nonbinary if this is meaningful for you. this is also an act of resistance to this colonial construction whose intention it is to erase you/to make you disappear.</p>
<p>and so by not disappearing, you resist.</p>
<p>the assertion of iaopoc ppl as IDing as nonbinary (or really any gender) is resistance.</p>
<p>in a more general sense, white supremacy is fundamentally predicated on a notion that white people are the only actual, fully realized humans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>as iaopoc asserting that you have an ID (gender or otherwise) is an assertion that you exist and are a (fully realized) human being. these acts of agency and resistance are important and necessary and really the first step to really (at least internally) decolonization. which is a really basic sense rests on the notion that we are human.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i'm spending so much time with this bc i'm suddenly struck with deja vu. bc i've had this conversation with another poc in the past...&nbsp;</p>
<p>and i failed to adequately express myself and they left the discussion in despair and no longer IDing as nonbinary bc they thought it was always going to be harmful, when it isn't harmful at all. but rather magical and something to be cherished.&nbsp;</p>
<p>you exist. you are human. you matter. using whichever words help you articulate these truths can never be harmful. please believe this.</p>
