question: Zubat got $22,000 from the project. I don't get why ppl couldn't donate that directly to TWoC instead of some ugly racist AFAB person? Like I know several trans women would KILL for a fraction of that money but that's not happening

answer: <p>i don’t think i realized it was this much money. i know it was 10K+ but...</p><p>so i’m not even wrong when i say they could’ve paid for one twoc’s surgery.&nbsp;</p><p>like i’m far from the worst off but, yeah, even a small portion of that would make a huge difference, much less the full amount.&nbsp;</p><p>i know twoc who’re homeless and trying their fucking hardest to get out of that.</p><p>i know twoc engaged in survival sex work who could use a nice vacation.</p><p>i know twoc too poor to afford any of the things that might help their dysphoria and/or make their daily lives safer.</p><p>i know twoc who can’t access medical care and can’t get their hormones.</p><p>and even if the entire thing wasn’t a fucking shit show, it still fucking makes me mad that half of teh leelah project’s stuff was supposed to go to trans man and/or other afab ppl.&nbsp;</p>
