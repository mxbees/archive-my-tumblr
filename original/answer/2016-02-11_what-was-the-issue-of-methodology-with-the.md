question: what was the issue of methodology with the clueless whites discussing the history of eugenics? no shade, genuinely curious

answer: <p>my main issue is that the OP presents this as some sort of novel problem, the fact that disabled ppl are a target of eugenics and no one caring.&nbsp;</p><p>but also that they think that disability is the only grounds for contemporary eugenics that ppl will defend and think is totally okay.</p><p>it isn’t.</p><p>white ppl regularly advocate eugenics against ppl of colour and most of them don’t even notice and, honestly, it is often celebrated in certain circles. but most especially *liberal* or left ones.</p>
