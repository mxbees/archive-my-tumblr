question: random ask: If "anti Asian racism" is an appropriation of the term "antiblack racism" and if Orientalism if a specific framework that doesn't just apply to Asia (i.e. North Africa), what do you generally call oppression of /racism against Asians? Actually now that I think about it, Idk if there's also a specific term for indigenous ppl either.... Or are there and I just don't know of them?

answer: <p>i’m not entirely clear why everyone needs their own&nbsp;</p><p>asians experience racism. that’s enough, i think.</p>
