question: mine, too, which is what i was trying to say. i just find it hard to imagine what it must be like to have images in your head all the time.

answer: <p>right? i have no flipping clue.</p><p>i mean. based on the vague memories i have of the one time i did acid and actually produced visual hallucinations, it can be pretty? i mean. the colours and shapes and whatever really really nice to look at.</p><p>from what ppl tell me, those with really well developed inner eyes, reading a novel is like watching a movie or some junk. which... i think is about the best way to try and understand?</p><p>like. the lord of the rings thing in my post. my friend said that was the way he pictured it (or close enough). so iâ€™m like. wait. reading the lord of the rings was a similar experience to watching it in the theatre? (visually speaking)?&nbsp;</p><p>how. what. why.</p>
