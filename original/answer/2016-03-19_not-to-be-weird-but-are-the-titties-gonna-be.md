question: Not to be weird but are the titties gonna be heavy? Like, is the material gonna replicate how heavy organic titties (with all that fat and tissue) are or are they supposed to be lighter so it's easier for people to get used to the changes?

answer: <p>huh. well. they felt heavy enough for me but i have no idea how they compare to free range boobs.</p><figure data-orig-height="251" data-orig-width="250"><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/10627d114c6cf5e7ee2e027959b76000/tumblr_inline_o4aas3av431rdzs46_500.gif" data-orig-height="251" data-orig-width="250"></figure>
