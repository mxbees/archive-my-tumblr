question: i think i'm a bit confused by the wording. you keep talking about "print-ready pdfs" so does that mean we'd be able to purchase physical books? or would it just be ebooks/web-books/whatever? thank you for this either way!

answer: <p>ah. yes. sorry. i’m using technical terms. lol.</p><p>a&nbsp;‘print-ready’ pdf is a pdf that is ready to be sent to the printers to create a physical book.</p><p>its different than what you give out as an e-book because the layout has to follow certain rules.&nbsp;</p><p>so what i use pressbooks for is to create that kind of pdf specifically, and these are the versions we pass onto the printer to create the physical books that ppl buy.</p><p>pressbooks is also great in that it also lets you create various ebook formats as well. overall, its actually a super useful piece of software and i like it much more for book design than using Adobe InDesign.</p>
