question: how is the critique of callout culture anti-Black?? i'm very confused

answer: <p>if u dig around online, u'll see that the earliest critiques of 'callout culture' are directed primarily and specifically at Black and/or Indigenous women (and other women of colour). But primarily Black women.&nbsp;</p><p>pretty much all critiques of callout culture tend to rely on these early frameworks for why it is bad, from white feminists towards Black women</p><p>these specific set of critiques is at least 6 years old and all of them are remarkably consistent in their logics and ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>to the extent that a identifiable callout culture even exists, it finds its roots within Black women's unwillingness to stfu about white feminists racist shit.&nbsp;</p><p>in general this is what callout culture is, if it exists:</p><p>Black ppl's unwillingness to stfu about the oppression the experience at the hands of ppl nominally on their 'side'</p><p>but in reality, callout culture _doesn't_ exist.&nbsp;</p><p>what exists is ppl being shitty and oppressive and the ppl they hurt not stfu about it. the ppl they harm actually demanding accountability and not silently suffering.&nbsp;</p><p>but of course, Black ppl, women especially, were never ever supposed to start talking back and actually shining a light on all the shitty anti-Black shit that the rest of us do.</p>
