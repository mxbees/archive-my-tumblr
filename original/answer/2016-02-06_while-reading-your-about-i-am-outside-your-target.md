question: While reading your about: i am outside your target audience, but i am also poor, so i can't yet support your writing monetarily. Are there any other ways to support your writing?

answer: <p>you don’t have to do anything if ur poor.&nbsp;</p><p>the&nbsp;‘target audience’ thing is really more about letting ppl know that they shouldn’t be surprised if i never (or rarely) talk about trans men, for example.</p><p>also just as a general notice that while i’m perfectly willing to share my writing in a public space like this. to have ppl reblog pretty much any and all of my posts, the only ppl i really think can make reasonable demands of me for labour are twoc.</p><p>in other words, i labour for us. any benefit to ppl outside of us is incidental and shouldn’t lead anyone to think that they can make demands for content or labour from me.<br></p>
