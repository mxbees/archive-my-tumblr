question: I'm not sure if all the comic sans stuff is a joke or not, but I want to point out that Century Gothic is also dyslexia friendly.

answer: <p>the comic sans thing isn't a joke.&nbsp;</p><p>i mean... i could've used Arial, which appears to be dyslexic friendly too.</p><p>(all my [info about dyslexic friendly fonts comes from here](<a href="http://bdatech.org/what-technology/typefaces-for-dyslexia/">http://bdatech.org/what-technology/typefaces-for-dyslexia/</a>))</p><p>which lists: Arial, comic sans, century gothic, verdana, trebuchet, lexia, open dyslexic, dyslexie all as being dyslexia friendly fonts.</p><p>(i think i like lexia the most, since i find it quite nice and is free for 'personal, school, college, and charity use'. open dyslexic is the only free, webfont on the list.... although most systems will have one of the MS fonts so that if you use them in &nbsp;your stylesheets, they should render okay)</p><p>i guess... when i was researching which fonts were good for dyslexia, a lot of dyslexics really liked comic sans, but thought it looked childish.&nbsp;</p><p>and a comment on twitter after i posted the gif made me think, since apparently there is some misogyny behind the motivation as labelling comic sans as an 'ugly' font. idk.&nbsp;</p><p>but yeah. i did pick comic sans for its readability and not as a way to poke fun at either dyslexic people or the content of the gifs.</p>
