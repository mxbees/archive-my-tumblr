question: I had some questions regarding respectful language. This post by This Is Not China, states that the use of "anti-Asian racism" isn't antiblack, but this runs counter to what I understand. Separately, I was under the impression that orientalism as a term covered a much more broad semantic area, considering its one of the three "logics"? Post in question: thisisnotchina () tumblr () com/post/96513404868/helpful-tagging-information

answer: <p>&nbsp;um....</p>
<p><a href="http://thisisnotchina.tumblr.com/post/96513404868/helpful-tagging-information">this is the link being discussed</a></p>
<p>first. as far as i can tell none of the ppl running that blog are Black asians... look. _Black_ ppl say that using 'anti-Asian' is an appropriation of 'anti-Blackness'. the thing that post doesn't appear to recognize is that 'anti-Blackness' isn't just about ~racism~. it is actually a _<a href="http://antiblacknessisatheory.tumblr.com/">theory</a>_ with robust scholarship and such, just as the same as orientalism. there is no such scholarship or discourse re: anti-Asian-ness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>so... a non-Black (I'm guessing Chinese person) saying, despite the many posts by Black ppl saying it is appropriation, that it isn't appropriation, is to be anti-Black. esp. since by framing asian issues in this way, we render invisible the work of Black creative people while --- AT THE VERY SAME TIME --- profiting from the discourse they created. this is like, textbook appropriation.</p>
<p>second. i'm kind of dying a little at the fact that a bunch of east asians are going on about how orientalism is limited in scope when they've actually done so much to dilute and declaw the discourse by making it pretty much about exotic representations of east asian cultures in pop culture. like... to the point where a lot of ppl don't even realize that it is a theory that was originally formulated to talk about Arab culture...</p>
<p>like... they are already responsible for expanding and reframing for what orientalism means and how it is used, so why the fuck would they care if we (as non-Black asians) work within this discourse to articulate the unique aspects of our oppression under white supremacy?</p>
<p>tldr: fuck ant-Black east asians. ur all a bunch of trash.</p>
