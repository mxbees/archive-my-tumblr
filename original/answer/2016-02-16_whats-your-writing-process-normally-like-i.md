question: What's your writing process normally like?  I mean, do you go straight to writing or do you think out loud first or somethign liek that?

answer: <p>i usually go straight to writing. usually an idea will occur to me and i’ll work out some of the details but i usually just start writing. i think you can tell from how i end some of my posts that i don’t often know where i’m going until i get to the end (bc sometimes i just end abruptly bc i have no idea where to go from there).</p><p>part of the issue, with me at least, is that i process information so slowly that my ideas usually blossom from seeds planted *months* or *years* ago and it usually feels sudden for me bc i do a lot of processing subconsiously. or something. idk.</p>
