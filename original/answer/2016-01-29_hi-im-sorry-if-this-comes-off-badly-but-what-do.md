question: Hi! I'm sorry if this comes off badly but what do you mean when you brought up people celebrating being jewish as being a white supremacist ? I can understand converts/plainly religious jews but are you including ethnically jewish people as well? i dont mean for this to come off as like an interrogation/offended i just have really bad reading comprehension and im not sure what you mean -M

answer: <p>oh.&nbsp;</p><p>that was me quoting someone else. sorry. i definitely *do not* think that ppl being proud of or celebrating being Jewish is white supremacist.&nbsp;</p><p>that particular post, i was drawing attention to someone who was being proud of being white and saying something to the effect of&nbsp;</p><p>“if even Jewish people can be proud to be Jewish, why can’t I be proud to be white?”<br></p><p>which to me is not only anti-Semitic but white supremacist.</p><p>i hope this clarifies it.</p>
