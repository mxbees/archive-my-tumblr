question: if you're bored enough to indulge a tech-n00b who can't figure out how to effectively search tumblr... is the trans men/misogyny thing because even if/when they get treated like women they don't process it internally as women? is there a more accurate way to express "being targetted by other people's misogyny when one is perceived to be a woman but is not"? how does that interact with, like, shifting identities (like, id as a woman before id'ing as a trans man)?

answer: <p>i have to say&#8230; i&#8217;m never clear why ppl insist on making this complicated&#8230;. (not u necessarily but this discussion happy at least once a month)</p>
<p>premise 1: men do not experience misogyny</p>
<p>premise 2: trans men are men</p>
<p>therefore: trans men do not experience misogyny</p>
<p>this is a classic syllogism. </p>
<p>.the thing is, is that it really is this easy.</p>
<p>trans men, as a subset of men, are those men who grow being treated as non-men. </p>
<p>being treated as a non-man does not entail being treated as a woman or being subject to misogyny. since non-man =/= woman. </p>

re: the language around this... some people use 'misdirected misogyny' but... idk. this sort of reasoning still strikes me as implying that trans men understand what it means to be treated like a woman, but they don't bc they don't have women's experiences, since they aren't women. like. 

when u say 'being targetted by other ppl's misogyny' but this isn't what is happening, they are being targetted by ppl's cissexism and cisnormativity, which thinks that bc they have certain bodies they are not-men.
