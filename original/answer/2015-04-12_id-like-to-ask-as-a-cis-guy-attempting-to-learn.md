question: I'd like to ask, as a cis guy attempting to learn about social issues: Would it be more preferable if I used "non-cis" or "non-binary" to refer to what people generally use "LGBT" & other umbrellas for, considering you and others hate all said umbrellas because of these "communities'" history for you all as TWOC? I ask because I don't want to accidentally step on people's toes... there's just so many differing and clashing opinions in general, really. Sorry if I'm just wasting your time here.

answer: <p>honestly it really depends. like. <br></p><p>i consciously use umbrella terms, at times, bc it is useful to have a general way to speak of these things. <br></p><p>um... i guess as person outside of the community, youâ€™re best off just using the common umbrella terms...<br></p>
