question: I know that this movement is not about white trans people and absolutely should not center those identities if they can even exist. But that's my question. Can a white person who feels not cis express that in a way that doesn't uphold a violent gender binary? How should it be done? And I know practically this isn't a major concern and that trans poc lives and safety are what is critical... But in a place where we hopefully move toward that what should white trans people do to express identity?

answer: <p>er...</p>
<p>i feel like this post is somewhat off the point since i've mainly been focusing on nonbinary white ppl, not white trans ppl as a whole.</p>
<p>so i'm not going to answer. since.... yeah.&nbsp;</p>
