question: Hey, you made a post called "pulling the threads of white supremacy together" like six months ago. I only just saw it and you're spot on (as usual), just one thing. Maybe change, "Arabic" to Arab as people generally use Arabic to refer to languages and Arab to refer to identity. Thank you!!

answer: <p>thanks for letting me know!&nbsp;</p><p>i thought someone had said somethign about this earlier and i corrected it but... i guess not?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;in any case, iâ€™ll try to dig up the post and edit.&nbsp;</p><p>sorry if any harm caused by it.&nbsp;</p>
