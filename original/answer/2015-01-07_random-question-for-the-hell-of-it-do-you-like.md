question: random question for the hell of it: do you like Janelle Monae/her music?

answer: <p>i haven't heard too much of her music. i've heard QUEEN and think that is a seriously awesome song, so i'd be willing to listen to more.</p>
<p>one of the bad things about me is that i have stupendously awful taste in music (mostly)</p>
