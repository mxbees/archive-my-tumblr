question: since the binary was created during colonialism to control poc populations, what happened to white trans ppl/tpoc that white ppl interacted with before colonialism?

answer: <p>i mean this is the kindest way possible but...</p><p>i don’t care.</p><p>sure. i have some ideas and some historical knowledge. but ultimately?</p><p>i don’t care about how white ppl treat other white ppl.</p><p>this is research you’ll have to do for yourself. sorry.</p><p>(also, you misconstrue my point: the binary wasn’t _created_ for colonialism, but colonialism is what turned it into a tool of oppression. there are binary poc cultures wherein the binary operates in a different way than it does as imposed and enforced by white ppl)</p>
