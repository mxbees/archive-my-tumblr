question: When ya said impure heathen I expected really explicit brony babyfur porn or a secret fetish for balloons. Either way, sorry you have followers or random people who poke through your likes to test for purity. It kinda sounds like your burned out tbh.

answer: so far...  no one has dug through my likes looking for my sins. but. I've also reached a point where I don't care anymore. 

perhaps,  yes,  I'm burned out. I mean. the past year and a half has really and utterly destroyed me. 

sadly. though. I can't stop. now that writing and doing whatever it is that I do around here is how I'm trying to put food on the table? just have to keep going. sadly. stopping or stepping away isn't a real option. I was really thinking about it in the fall. but. 

here I am.

more open and vulnerable than ever before.
