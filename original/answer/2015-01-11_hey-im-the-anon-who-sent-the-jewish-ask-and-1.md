question: Hey I'm the anon who sent the Jewish ask and, 1) thank you for answering the question but 2) I'm very sorry for asking the question. I did not intend to contribute to the stress you're feeling. You're not imagining things, your health is important and if reading that stuff hurts you please don't continue, especially not for the sake of strangers'. My questions / wish for understanding / knowledge doesn't take precedence over your health.

answer: <p>oh. hey. cool. thanks for this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>like. i didn't have to answer but i was feeling... something? lol.</p>
<p>i should log off and take a nap or something.</p>
<p>the other part of the problem (atm) is that i've been up since 4, which is like when i decided would be a good time to finish that galton book.........</p>
<p>dear ppl,</p>
<p>don't read books by people who invented eugenics at 4 in the morning. it isn't good for your health.</p>
<p>love,</p>
<p>b.</p>
