question: why was the car alarm post ridiculous?

answer: <p>how often do u actually pay attention when a car alarm goes off?</p>
<p>99.9% of the time i ignore it.</p>
<p>as far as i can tell, no one pays attention to car alarms bc 99.9% of the time they are false alarms and so they fail to be 'alarming' in any meaningful way.</p>
