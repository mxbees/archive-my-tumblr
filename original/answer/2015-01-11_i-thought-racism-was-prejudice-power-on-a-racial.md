question: I thought racism was prejudice + power on a racial basis. Yes, Jewish, Italians,etc were (are?) lesser white but they were still white. I understand how they can benefit from white supremacy but still experience oppression but is calling it racism accurate?

answer: <p>well. my understanding of that formulation of racism is that the 'prejudice' is _racial_ prejudice. so... yeah. ok. sorry i'm re-reading your sentence and we don't disagree.&nbsp;</p>
<p>the thing is, is that the sub races within caucasian (like if u read the stuff on eugenics) absolutely treats the inferior white races as distinct races, even if they were white.</p>
<p>but. like. the way u phrased this question perfectly illustrates my point about how racial discourse has become MORE reductive and LESS complex.&nbsp;</p>
<p>what you say is... true insofar as we only consider modern race relations and modern race discourse.</p>
<p>but historically? no. not really.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(tw: genocide, holocaust)</p>
<p>like. when Jewish people say that the nazis targeted them for _racial_ genocide they are totally and completely correct. bc. that was a _eugenics_ plan for getting rid of the 'bad' white 'stock'. like. this is how we can see how an distinct form of oppression (like anti-Semitism -- which predates racism) became subsumed under racism (at least for a period of time) and how it was a racial prejudice that motivated nazi power. this is racism.</p>
