question: as far as i know, ace stereotypes are mostly within "the community", as aceness still hasn't reached a point where most folks acknowledge/recognize asexuality as a sexual orientation/identification.

answer: <p>*nods*&nbsp;</p><p>this is what i suspected. this doesn’t detract from the harmfulness of the stereotypes. i mostly just wanted to know about the scope of the stereotypes. bc... since i don’t ID as ace (even though i could), i don’t really have much (or any) interaction with teh community.&nbsp;</p>
