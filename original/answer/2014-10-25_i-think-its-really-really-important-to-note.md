question: "I think itâ€™s really, really important to note that indigeneity, while it comes with its troubles, does not necessarily come with POCness." Excuse me??? 'while it comes with its troubles' that's the most silencing shit I've ever heard. Speaking as a person enrolled in a tribe here in the US, US ndns are routinely talked over by all other poc and our shit is appropriated by other poc at an overwhelming rate. We ARE poc and our voices should be centered b/c THIS IS OUR LAND. good lord.

answer: <p>You realize I didn't write that, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I agreed with it, but I didn't write it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might want to take it up with the person who wrote that... who happens to be a Black person and, thus, a better arbiter of who does or does not count as a 'person of colour' than either of us.</p>
<p>But since you appear to have missed your daily dose of nuance today, I'm going to link you to someone you might listen to. <a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s102/sh/e041ff70-dbfb-48e4-b4cb-4af0e2f5a940/b7a9cc09f6f436ec9260c3da118515f1">this was posted on&nbsp;apihtawikosisan's now defunct tumblr. read the link</a>.</p>
<p>i also see that you don't understand <a href="http://youtu.be/82vl34mi4Iw">the history of 'poc'</a> and why what you are saying here is anti-Black, and especially erasing the reality of Indigenous Black ppl by this statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i've no problem, as a settler, saying that Indigenous ppl must be centered because, yes, I'm on your land.</p>
<p>What i don't get, is what this has to do with being a 'person of colour'. Especially given the history of the term.&nbsp;</p>
