question: I've always been confused by the line of thinking that women rejecting and hating femininity and adopting only masculinity=smashing the patriarchy and rejecting gender rolls and being radical but women rejecting and hating masculinity and adopting only femininity=brain washed tool of the patriarchy who doesn't understand and is bad and vapid. I was wondering if you had any thoughts on this matter?

answer: <p>not entirely sure that i have anything to add to this that ppl haven’t already talked about elsewhere...</p><p>like. the thing with femininity is that ppl really fucking hate it (even the ppl who claim to love it). femmes for a long time have been accused of being regressive patriarchy lovers.&nbsp;</p><p>all i really want is a world/community where how ~radical~ you are isn’t tied to an ever changing and ultimately unknowable group of rules for performance and how to look.&nbsp;</p>
