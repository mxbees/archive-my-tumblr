question: did you even *read* about the history of china, japan and korea? japan imperalized china and korea VIOLENTLY around 20th centuary. and then right after the ww2 usa & soviets forced its imperalism on korea and ended up dividing it up in two, also violently. and not to mention, there was also colonialism forced into china in form of violent communism. honestly, as you're clearly not east asian, you really shouldnt be talking about our issues lmao as you're clearly too racist and ignorant abt us.

answer: <p>this is hilarious. i apparently know more about the history of the region than you do.</p><p>although i do find it interesting that you’ve conflated imperialism with colonialism.&nbsp;</p><p>no. not east asian, thank god. i don’t have the hubris of think that i’m the centre of asian discourse.</p><p>lol @ being too racist.&nbsp;</p>
