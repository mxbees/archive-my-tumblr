question: (hi i'm the whipping girl anon form ages ago) if it's not going to be "officially" published, is there a way we can read the draft? i'm still super interested in reading and supporting your work, so if there's a way to access that i'd totally love to!

answer: <p>hey!</p><p>sorry i wasn’t clear, but yeah, i’m probably going to put the draft up for sale tomorrow or something.&nbsp;</p><p>i was mostly not doing it today bc i already did a patreon update, lol.</p><p>also, i didn’t check the pdf after i made the thing and it is... a mess, lmao.&nbsp;</p><p>so a bit more polishing there (and elsewhere) and i should be good to go!</p><p>what do you think a good price would be? i was thinking $5 bc it is original work that is about 48,000 words.</p><p>omfg, i just checked the pdf and if i were to print it as a standard trim, it’d be around 180 pages.&nbsp;</p><p>WOW</p><p>bc the chapters are all individual files i um... didn’t notice that it was so fucking long. omg.</p><p>yeah. ok. $5 seems reasonable. half the book was edited. just not the second half.</p>
