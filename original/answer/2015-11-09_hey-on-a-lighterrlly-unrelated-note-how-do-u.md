question: hey on a lighter/rlly unrelated note, how do u feel abt forceful vegetarians/vegans. lately i just had one attack me bc i eat the eggs my chickens lay, instead of just wasting all of them or letting them rot i guess. honestly every time it happens i just remember tht one time someone told me i should just starve in place of eating meat bc money was tight and meat was cheap lmao..have u ever had one of them get on ur case ?

answer: <p>O.o</p><p>i can’t remember the last time i was cornered with a militant veg*</p><p>how to respond depends on the person and context. i mean. sometimes is best to ignore and walk away. sometimes its best to tell them to fuck off.</p><p>thinking about it. its really been a long time since i’ve known any white ppl who’re likely to do this. i’ve managed to mostly stay far away from white leftists/radicals, who’re the most likely ppl to tell me/you ideological purity is worth starving to death for.&nbsp;</p><p>i am sorry that you’v had to deal with this. it can be really tough to deal with.&nbsp;</p><p>but. this much is true: you deserve to live. which means eating what you can. so fuck&nbsp;‘em.</p>
