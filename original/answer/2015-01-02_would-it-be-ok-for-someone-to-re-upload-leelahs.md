question: would it be ok for someone to re-upload Leelah's blog onto another tumblr? even with the same name if it's available

answer: <p>sure?&nbsp;</p>
<p>i don't exactly see why not. i mean, all the data is there, if people want to put up a copy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>as far as i'm concerned, the more copies the better.</p>
<p>not sure why her blog is gone, but her note makes it very clear that we need to listen and make her death mean something.</p>
<p>if it just... vanishes, then it'll be easy for her parents (and the media) to just.......</p>
<p>sweep this away.</p>
