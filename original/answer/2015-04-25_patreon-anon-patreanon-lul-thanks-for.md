question: (patreon anon [patreanon? lul]) thanks for expounding on that; i really appreciate it. and, i don't know if the comments on inaccessible writing were prompted by my ask, but... your stuff is definitely "advanced reading" for me on occasion (and i need a few of the intermediate steps spelled out) but i always feel that it's worth the effort for me. <3

answer: <p>no, the inaccessible writing thing was about you, someone else.&nbsp;</p><p>one of the constant critiques i’ve had of my writing is that i often will jump a few steps in my reasoning and not fully explain how i got to my conclusions. like. i always have a good reason for them, just... don’t always share them.&nbsp;</p><p>last thing i have to say about sort of why the chapter/section might’ve been confusing...</p><p>the thing is, is that i often refuse to accept other ppl’s framing for discussions. so, in this case, the problem with serano is that she simply assumes that the binary or a bimodal distribution is perfectly obvious and thus requires no evidence or support from her to establish its truth.&nbsp;</p><p>i refuse this framing.</p><p>rather, i argue and speak from a place where the binary (both sex and gender) isn’t real. and, thus, it is serano and other adherents of the binary who must demonstrate its truth/validity to me, not the other way around.&nbsp;</p><p>so when she uses a word like&nbsp;‘recognize’ for something like bimodal sexes, i’m just like.&nbsp;</p><p>i recognize no such thing.&nbsp;‘recognition’ depends on the thing being recognized actually existing, we just need to see/notice it.&nbsp;</p><p>but all of this can make reading my responses confusing, bc it looks like i’m talking about stuff that isn’t there.&nbsp;</p>
