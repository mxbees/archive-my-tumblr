question: wait, are all body mods/tattoos appropriative if a white person gets them? like, of all sorts?

answer: <blockquote>
<p>Instead, all I&rsquo;ve been asking is for white people to think about their privilege and the history of tattooing and understand how their actions do occur within a larger colonial context that they need to be aware of. And not even about just tattoos because this is shit that they should be thinking about anyway (or at least the good ones do).</p>
<p>However. It appears too much to ask the white community to reflect on this stuff and maybe to some of their own heavy lifting to actually think about their actions beyond their fierce individualism and the &ldquo;I can do whatever I want without consequences&rdquo; bullshit they so often reply with.</p>
