question: Regarding rice & fatty livers: I'm in the same boat. My doctor suggested I switch to brown rice instead of white rice, and I just laughed in my head. I can't live without my white rice..... Rice is life.

answer: <p>right?&nbsp;</p><p>but maybe youâ€™d benefit from parboiled rice. since it really is a good compromise bw white and brown.&nbsp;</p>
