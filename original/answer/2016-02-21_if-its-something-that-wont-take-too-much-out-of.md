question: If it's something that won't take too much out of you to answer - what is the greatest written account(s) of whiteness that you know of/would recommend? i.e. comprehensive, historically accurate and coherent account(s) of the origins, history and status of white as a racial category (or anything you'd say approaches that in a good way.)

answer: <p>if what ur wanting to learn about is whiteness specifically, i’d go with <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B003HQ3XHQ">Nell Irvine Painter’s, _The History of White People_</a>. her historical work is great. i don’t agree entirely with her framing or some of her conclusions, but her book is about a million times better than anything written by white people about whiteness.</p><p>that’s my last comment too... don’t try to learn about whiteness from white people. one would think they their intimate experience of being white would inform them... but they pretty much end up propping up white supremacy. or spreading disinformation.&nbsp;</p><p>in other words: do not trust anything white ppl write about race. their own or anyone else’s.&nbsp;</p><p>even if they say something worthwhile you can almost always find a poc who’s done a better job (like Painter).&nbsp;</p>
