question: do non-binary white ppl have privilege over women as a whole (including cis white women)? i think yes but appreciate and value your input

answer: <p>i honestly don’t know what to think of this question.&nbsp;</p><p>like. the question assumes a certain flattening of various axes of oppression and, yeah, i can’t really engage it.&nbsp;</p><p>i mean. on one level, you’re asking me if one group of (white) trans people is privileged over a group of (white) cis people.&nbsp;</p><p>does this question really make sense to you?</p><p>is&nbsp;‘non-binary white people’ actually a coherent category of analysis if we look at this via a lens of power and oppression?&nbsp;</p><p>anyway.</p><p>the short answer to this question is&nbsp;“it’s complicated”</p>
