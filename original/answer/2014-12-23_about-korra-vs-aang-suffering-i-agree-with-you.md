question: about Korra vs Aang suffering: I agree with you but I don't know how to make the distinction between the way Korra suffered to develop and how Aang suffered (since he lost his people).

answer: <p>the distinction... is</p>
<p>is that _all_ of korra's learning and character development happened as a result of violence against her, violence that we saw. we had to see her brown body broken, beaten, and battered at the end of the first three seasons. until she was molded, i guess into what the white writers of the show thought she should be like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>aang's suffering was more of a background sort of thing. the framework in which his character developed from child to avatar.</p>
<p>and the difference between how the show treated the two? we are supposed to empathise with aang but cheer on korra being beaten up.</p>
<p>how many ppl watched that part with korra and toph and were like smiling and happy and laughing at the way that korra can apparently only learn when she is being physically (and emotionally) abused?&nbsp;</p>
<p>like. the framing of korra and her character discourages ppl from feeling any empathy with the fact that she grew up in a _really_ sheltered environment where she was literally told every. single. day. that she was special. so yeah, she was spoiled and innocent _at the same time_. but.&nbsp;</p>
<p>like all media narratives involving spoiled children the lesson we learn is that cruelly punishing these kids as a way to teach them that the world isn't ~fair~ is apparently the only way to ~humble~ them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>tie into this the fact that korra is darker skinned than aang _and_ that her gender expression isn't stereotypically feminine, and it all gets tangled up into issues of racialized misogyny.</p>
