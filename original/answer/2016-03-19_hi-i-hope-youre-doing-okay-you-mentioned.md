question: hi. i hope you're doing okay. you mentioned re-watching atla some days (weeks ?) ago and not liking zuko. Can i ask you what you think of jet ? and if you have a favorite character (and also a 'favorite' minor character, if you don't mind) ?

answer: <p>i’m doing good. i’m having fun being a nerd with my coding today. even though i said i’d do real writing and my nails are a fucking mess.&nbsp;</p><p>yes! we are almost done with the rewatch. only three episodes left. :D</p><p>jet was.... meh. i think my problem is that i don’t really understand being that angry about something.&nbsp;</p><p>i feel like i should say toph but that also feels like too much of an easy answer. like. sure. she’s awesome and there are many things i like about her character but... idk. i feel in some ways she wasn’t allowed to be as complex and nuanced as the other characters. but i think i identify most with her...idk, not being angsty about every fucking thing.&nbsp;</p><p>i’m trying to think of another main character i’d call my favourite but i can’t. lol. part of why i like avatar is that most of the characters are sufficiently developed that there are things i can like and dislike about all of them. as in, i have mixed feelings about most of the characters. which is refreshing, tbh.</p><p>favourite minor character... hrm. god. i’ve been sitting here for five minutes trying to figure this out. no one is really popping into my head. :S</p>
