question: Have you ever read Sherilyn Kenyon or JR Ward? Sorry I heard you like trashy romance novels and it's kinda my thing lol.

answer: <p>JR Ward, no. But Sherilyn Kenyon, yes. I think there was only one dark hunter novel that i particularly liked, but overall i’m not a big fan of the series. if we are talking this kind of romance, i think my fav is Kelley Armstrong.&nbsp;</p><p>right now, i’m pretty only listening to mm. but i did a big... four or five year long stint in het romance like ten years ago.&nbsp;</p>
