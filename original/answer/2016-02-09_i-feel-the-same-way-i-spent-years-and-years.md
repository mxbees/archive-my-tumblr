question: i feel the same way. i spent years and years trying to just ignore the parts of me that screamed "i can't do this" and by doing so i've lost the ability to tell when i can and when i can't. most of the time, it's just me getting hurt. but i can tell people what works, how i continue to live despite the erosion of contentment with what that means.

answer: <p>yup.</p><p>i feel like... one of the reasons why i’ve become such a failure as a Person with a Career</p><p>is bc i burned through so much of my... idk what to call it? lifetime spoon supply? ignoring the screaming of my body and mind in order to keep going, so i could meet some arbitrary standard of Success.</p><p>i put so much of my resources into figuring out how to survive through school, that i feel like i broke myself and can’t figure out how to survive not being in school.</p>
