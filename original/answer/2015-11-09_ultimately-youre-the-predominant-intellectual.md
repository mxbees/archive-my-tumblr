question: ultimately you're the predominant intellectual influence in my life. there's a lot of ideas you say that i'd never think of, or you think about it better, or ideas other's have had that you write more accessibly. so i know i've benefited a lot off your labor over like 3 years. today i felt like telling you how great you are. i know other's were involved in your understanding, but that doesn't change the fact that you most of all helped me be at least somewhat better. thank you so much.

answer: <p>oh! you are very very welcome.&nbsp;</p><p>i really appreciate this message. :D</p>
