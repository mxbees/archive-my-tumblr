question: I feel like someone asking you to die to save the planet is especially heinous because they're saying your death will somehow improve things for everyone else. Other people get to see the world improve, but not you, you get to live in the crapsack world or die. And that's a /horrible/ implication. (I agree about Toronto's transfer system, by the way. I wonder if it's not worth it to just try anyway. It seems like they wouldn't be able to tell/notice.)

answer: <p>yup. like this is appears to be the message we get from white environmentalists:</p><p>if only poc would stop existing, the planet would be okay and we could continue consuming the globe’s resources unhindered.</p><p>(re: transfer. yeah. that’s pretty much what i did. way too fucking cold this morning for walking around.)</p>
