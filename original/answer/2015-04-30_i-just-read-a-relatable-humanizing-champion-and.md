question: I just read "a relatable humanizing champion" and you said a lot of what i'm feeling and didn't have the words to articulate. I'm currently having an argument with someone over Baltimore and how Black people are at the forefront of many social protests, only to be written out after things are accomplished/mainstream accepted (Marsha P. Johnson at stonewall for example/Ida B. Wells in Women's Suffrage). and you helped me be more secure in my stance. so thanks

answer: <p>oh! i’m really glad to hear that. i’ve not been able to write a lot recently bc of depression reduced motivation, lack of focus, etc. so i’m glad that i managed to get my point across....</p><figure data-orig-height="180" data-orig-width="160"><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/4ad62fef92bb5d49e962ab482350594a/tumblr_inline_nnn27hZXhV1rdzs46_500.gif" data-orig-height="180" data-orig-width="160"></figure>
