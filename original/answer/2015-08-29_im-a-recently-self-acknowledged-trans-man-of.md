question: im a recently self-acknowledged trans man of color, and the stuff i've seen from you and other folx on tumblr/twitter about trans MRAs has really hit home. cuz for real, that shit is all over trans masc communities i've been lurked around in. there is one part of it that im still struggling to think thru clearly, an while i will abs take twoc at their word, i would rather *understand*, so - do you know of a good entry-level explanation wrt male privilege and non-passing ppl?

answer: <p>Um... I don’t know of anything. In part because I tend not to read stuff that is targeted towards trans men. But I don’t think I’ve seen nearly as much self-reflection about male privilege pre-transition and non-blending amongst trans men as I have trans women.&nbsp;</p><p>I could probably analyse this to some degree, but it’d be better coming from a trans man.&nbsp;</p><p>I will say that in regards to the MRA thing, it really looks like some trans men are attempting to split hairs about&nbsp;‘cis male privilege’ =\=&nbsp;‘trans male privilege’. Insofar as there might be differences... idk.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe followers will have suggestions for resources.</p>
