question: It costs money to change your name in your bank? It cost me $40 to legally change mine and $7 for a new ID. My bank changed my name on my account for free and so did my job. I just didn't change it on my BC bc I'm not in the state I was born in

answer: <p>no... the banks are free. but. i honestly was just exhausted by the time i got to that point. and everyone had slightly different documentation requirements. pretty much all of them expect you to come into the bank and do the thing. which is great and all. but i’m agoraphobic and... yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>literally the only thing i did change was the *one* credit card that allowed me to scan and email documents.&nbsp;</p><p>this was going to be the other thing i was just about to post about. bc... doing the name and gender marker thing (should you so desire) isn’t just difficult because of all the beuaracratic barriers. and this includes trying to talk to people who’re often disrespectful and even more often utterly clueless about what to do for trans ppl (it took me a lot of effort to get accurate information from the ppl who fucking worked there. and when i was getting my new health card and ID, it was literally&nbsp;‘we need a surgeon’s letter’ and i was like&nbsp;‘you literally changed this fucking regulation FIVE YEARS ago wtf’)</p><p>but. this honestly intersected a lot with various disabilities that made the entire thing about a million times more miserable than was strictly required. a few of the things i had to bring my bf along with me bc i was too anxious. or whatever. and ugh. it was all so draining. :(</p>
