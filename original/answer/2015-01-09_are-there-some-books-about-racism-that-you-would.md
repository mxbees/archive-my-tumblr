question: are there some books about racism that you would recommend people read, written by nonwhite people?

answer: <p>oh god. i should preface this by noting that i don't often read books like this anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>these recs are from people i trust and who do read books like this:</p>
<p>_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_White_People">history of white people</a>_ by Nell Irvin Painter</p>
<p>_<a href="http://uncpress.unc.edu/books/T-4951.html">Black Marxism</a>_ by Cedric Robinson</p>
<p>_<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Red-White-Black-Structure-Antagonisms/dp/0822347016">Red, White &amp; Black: Cinema and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms</a>_ by Frank B. Wilderson</p>
<p>and these are the only ones that come to mind, at present. but especially the first one, if you want an historical perspective of racism in america.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i'm sure people can reblog this with more recommendations.</p>
