question: Could you elaborate on why calling non-aces "sexuals" is upsetting to you & others in this site?

answer: <p>Because it reduces everyone’s (included aces’) sexuality to fucking. Who you fuck, how much you fuck, etc and so on.</p><p>Because the _hypersexuality_ of gays and lesbians and trans women has been used as a weapon against the respective communities for _years_.</p><p>Because there is a perfectly acceptable alternative (allosexual) that doesn’t involve weaponizing ppl’s sexual desire against them.</p><p>Because the _racial_ implications behind calling any qtpoc ‘sexual’ is disgusting and white supremacist. </p><p>This is what I can think of off the top of my head.</p>
