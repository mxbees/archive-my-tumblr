question: my memory is so bad i cant remember who you are exactly and i dont remember how but i remember your theories and stuff influenced me and others and i wont forget that

answer: <p>???</p><p>i’m not quite sure how to parse this.</p><p>but its cool. really.</p><p>in case ur wondering about the URL changes and how to trace it all back...</p><p>my first (most popular) username was&nbsp;‘biyuti’.&nbsp;</p><p>but then i deleted that blog and started using my pen-name (the one for publishing)&nbsp;‘b. binaohan’</p><p>and then i recently just changed it to&nbsp;‘mxbees’.&nbsp;</p><p>not sure if this helps or not. i mean... technically, i’ve tied this account to my&nbsp;‘irl’ identity too, but it isn’t really at the forefront so i’d be surprised if anyone actually found me via that way (well, ok, beyond the few i specifically told).</p>
