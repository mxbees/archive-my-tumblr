question: yu totally dont have to reply publicly, but i just wanted to thank you again! (for answering an being charitable and talking bout uninteresting things) i can see how the convo can go a bunch of sketchy places and that was def not what i was trying to do. i just had never 100% got it (and yes, def a bit hung up on edge cases), and ur explanations usually make a lot of sense to me and r super interesting (like who else is going to drop that buddhism tidbit on me?). and also the non-anon is not me.

answer: <p>cool.</p>
<p>like. idk. sometimes i get in the right mood for these sorts of things. other times it feels like i'm just being asked to do the heavy lifting for someone else... which sucks.</p>
<p>i mean. i get that some ppl like the way i write/talk about stuff (ok. i don't really get it _get it_ but i understand in in an abstract way even though it seems a little bizarre for me)</p>
<p>but questions like that one are really about how ppl who don't have bodies/selves like me experience oppression and it isn't necessarily my place to really... idk set out the discursive terms for it. at least not in a positive sort of way. being able to delineate the negative boundaries (ie, discussing what it _isn't_ is something i can do, but not really what it _is_ since i don't have actual access to that perspective).&nbsp;</p>
