question: How does Julia assert her bioligal essentialism and radical feminst views? I thought she was pretty lib.

answer: <p>lol. no.&nbsp;</p><p>i just posted this excerpt on twitter that is a partial explanation:</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="290" data-orig-width="619"><img src="https://41.media.tumblr.com/a63e317a55e13089d5cf9fc731902de3/tumblr_inline_nnc41atnH01rdzs46_540.png" data-orig-height="290" data-orig-width="619"></figure><p>serano firmly believes that patriarchy is TEH oppression. she literally reduces all gender-based oppression to&nbsp;‘oppositional sexism’ (which depends on the reification of the white binary). this means that transmisogyny (yes she coined the term) is not actually a distinct thing, but rather a subset of misogyny.&nbsp;</p><p>her biological essentialism is pretty evident in her made up theory of&nbsp;‘subconscious sex’ and outright rejection of social constructionism.&nbsp;</p>
