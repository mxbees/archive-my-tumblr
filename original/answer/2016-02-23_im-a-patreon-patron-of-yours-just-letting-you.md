question: I'm a Patreon patron of yours. Just letting you know that I would keep doing it even if your writing stopped being so frequent or dried up entirely. Like one of your earlier asks said, I signed up not to ask for extra labor but rather to compensate you for the labor you had/are doing.

answer: <p>:D</p><p>this is good to hear. and i really do appreciate it.</p><p>i guess... the other thing with why i try to make sure to keep writing stuff is in the hopes to get new patrons too.&nbsp;</p><p>like. it would be fucking amazing if i could meet some of my larger milestones.</p><p>esp. the ones related to basically releasing all my stuff for free.&nbsp;</p><p>but ultimately, i’m trying to prepare for the future. i’m super grateful to have my current job... but at some point i’ll be moving out of this city. and since i’m unemployable, i’m hoping that my writing *might* be able to support me by that point.&nbsp;</p><p>i think about this a lot. its also why i’m thinking about changing my mind about making public appearances bc... public speaking can bring in money.</p><p>i hate thinking about my writing like this. but i don’t really have a choice at this point.&nbsp;</p><p>it does help that i genuinely enjoy writing.</p>
