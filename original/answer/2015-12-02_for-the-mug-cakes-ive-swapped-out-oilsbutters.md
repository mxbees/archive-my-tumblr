question: for the mug cakes: ive swapped out oils/butters for things like pumpkin puree and apple sauce (butters and oils fuck my stomach over so bad lol) and they work just fine! same w/ egg replacements! mug cakes are truly a gift

answer: <p>oh! this is interesting.</p><p>yeah. this totally is a great idea if you canâ€™t do butter or oil.</p><p>hmm... i may end up trying the apple sauce to reduce the fat content...</p><p>thanks for the tip!</p>
