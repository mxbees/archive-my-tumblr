question: okay but you have always been a huge lesbophobe. you hate lesbians. you act like lesbianism is a white thing. you treat trans lesbians like they're 'not really' committed. that is why you are catching shit. because people KNOW you are 'libfem' by which we mean you prioritize white supremacist, patriarchal, violent, gendered ideas of what a woman should be. you love calling lesbian trans women all sorts of made up shit whenever you can.
