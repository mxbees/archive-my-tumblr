question: But I also am just really confused because Latinx isn't a race; it's an ethnicity, afaik.  So there can be white latinx ppl and black latinx ppl and red latinx people etc. I see many latinx people, when getting into the topics of racism, claim that their oppression is worse than that of black people but I'm really confused on that (and don't think it's true)  So, I'm basically asking how Latinx ppl fit into the hierarchy and how should they be treated in race discussions? (2/2)

answer: <p>lol. i guess i sort of answered this with the previous answer?</p>
<p>non-Black latinx ppl claiming their oppression is worse than Black ppl is total anti-Blackness</p>
<p>latinx ppl should be treated within discussions of racism just as any other ethnicity that can have more than one race within?&nbsp;</p>
<p>but that is a little disingenuous since Latin@ is the only ethnicity marked by the american census and part of this is bc, as a whole, it is an oppressed ethnicity...</p>
<p>i guess this can sort of answer your question like thus: since latin@ is a marginalized ethnicity, it relates to race in much the same as any other marginalized ethnicity</p>
<p>as in...</p>
<p>some ppl within will have compounding effects of having to deal with a marginalized ethnicity + marginalized race.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i hope this helps...</p>
