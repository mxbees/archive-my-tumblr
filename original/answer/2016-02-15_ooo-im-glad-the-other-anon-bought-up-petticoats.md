question: Ooo Im glad the other anon bought up petticoats! If your going the petticoat route then the pettis made of chiffon are soft BUT have more layers (so they are warmer) but the ones made of netting are scratchy but lighter weight (but they deflate too).

answer: <p>:D</p><p>iâ€™d probably go the soft but warmer route bc... scratchy is not part of the cozy femme aesthetic.</p>
