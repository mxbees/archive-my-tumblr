question: hi! i'm super excited to hear about your upcoming essay anthology! i'd absolutely love to buy it and support your work, but i have a question: is there any chance it will be available in print? i have recurring migraines, and it's usually easier for me to read a book in print rather than on a screen. thank you for making it available either way!

answer: <p>oh yeah! it’ll be for print.&nbsp;</p><p>the idea is that i’m collecting all the long essays i’ve written in 2015 (anything over 3k-4k words), esp. the ones i’m selling individually, and putting them together in a print book that’ll be cheaper than buying all others individually.&nbsp;</p><p>i was thinking like. $5 originally, but the minimum price i have to charge is more than that (ie, the materials to make each book costs more than $5).</p><p>i’m hoping to finish editing and get it out in the next week or so.</p>
