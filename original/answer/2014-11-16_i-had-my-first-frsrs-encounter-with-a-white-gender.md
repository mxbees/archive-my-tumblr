question: I had my first frsrs encounter with a white gender abolitionist radfem today and. Oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god. Oh my GOD. (this is my horrified shell-shocked way of saying thank you so much for everything you've done to help dismantle that ideology) (also I am not a Feminist Scholar but it seems like that ideology upholds patriarchy (not to mention colonialism etc) just as much as actual patriarchy?? is that correct? ) (also also I can't find your donate button where is it)

answer: <p>i removed the button since i received enough donations to last me a little while...</p>
<p>lol. i remember my first encounter with a white radfem... just. yeah.</p>
<p>as far as the patriarchy and colonialism goes...</p>
<p>have you seen this old post of mine?</p>
