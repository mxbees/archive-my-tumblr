question: All the freelance writers I admire and like besides one mostly cite good editors as their main source of improvement. And what they define as good editors is someone that can edit in ways that do not water down or police their style. So I guess that would be that. I also really like your voice. It's very distinctive. I would describe it as wry, sparse, to the point, I guess.
