question: thank you so much for explaining how!

answer: <p>you are very welcome!</p><p>i really wish there were more... easy? obvious? ways to do it.&nbsp;</p><p>like. i know for me the&nbsp;‘wget’ option is easy. it takes me about a minute to start archiving my tumblr (which i haven’t done it too long).</p><p>the wordpress option is best for those who can’t do commandline stuff... but it’s slow and messy. esp. the more posts you have.</p><p>oh!</p><p>and i forgot that if you have posted a lot of original media, getting that stuff is actually and entirely different process. but i’d hope that most ppl kept their original copies....</p>
