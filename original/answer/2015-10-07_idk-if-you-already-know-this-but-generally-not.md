question: idk if you already know this but generally not sleeping on your back helps sleep apnea. sorry if this redundant and old news but maybe if it isnt it could help? wishing you health and the best

answer: <p>yeah. this is what he ended up telling me, to sleep on my sides. <br></p><p>which i’m like, ‘u were going to let me walk out of here and not say a single fucking thing?’</p><p>he even checked my sleep study data and actually said that my sleep apnea is minimal to (possibly) non-existent when i’m on my sides. and like didn’t think this was potentially useful information for someone too poor to afford the fucking $1000 machine???<br></p>
