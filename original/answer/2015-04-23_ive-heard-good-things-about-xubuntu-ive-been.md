question: i've heard good things about xubuntu. i've been running elementary for day-to-day usage (my favorite distro) but debian is pretty nice too

answer: <p>elementary is nice! a little too.... slick as far as the GUI is concerned. i’m not really big into GUI heavy distros, since i love the command line.&nbsp;</p><p>like. i don’t actually like ubuntu (bc of the terrible fucking name) but i do like the xfce desktop, since it allows for the kinds of customization that i like (like changing all menu buttons to text only, no icons). it also has compositing built in, which i really like even though it is just graphic candy. PLUS PLUS it uses thunar as the file manager, which turns out to be my favourite one. lol. like. as much as i do like crunchbang, it has pcfman (or whatever) as the file manager which i’m&nbsp;‘meh’ over. but has openbox as window manager, which i really like.&nbsp;</p><p>i’m really only using ubuntu 14.04 right now for two reasons:</p><p>the ability to plug my (android) phone in and transfer data</p><p>and wget 1.4+</p><p>debian 8 should have all of these, so i’m probably going to do debian8 + xfce desktop whenever it comes out.&nbsp;</p>
