question: isn't it said that the two water tribes had a civil war? that on top of the huge distance between them might play into it

answer: yeah. i guess this makes sense. I can't remember much of the lore. 

the distance does make sense. but it's also in terms of how they live. like the northern water tribes is in large buildings and such. 

and the other is small villages? idk.
