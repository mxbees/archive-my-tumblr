question: Janelle Monae Yoga anon: sorry I sent you that ask. I didn't mean it as a trap. At the time i couldnt find black ppl talking about it and i didnt know how to deal w/ it so I asked u cuz I didn't want to accidentally say something bad & ur smart about nbpoc antiblckness. But a couple days ago gradientlair posted about it so now I know. And I understand what my problem was & how my pov was antiblack so I'll be reflecting & accounting for that. Just telling you this as fyi. Sorry again.

answer: <p>oh. this is nice to know!</p><p>i’m wary of traps bc i’ve been baited in the past before.&nbsp;</p><p>but... as &nbsp;you can see from the ensuing discussion, this sort of thing is super complex and i’m definitely not the sort of person who ought answer a question about Black ppl and appropriation of a culture i don’t belong to.</p><p>something to keep in mind in the future.</p>
