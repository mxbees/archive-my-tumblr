question: hi, i just read your post about rhetorical questions for white people, and you mentioned not getting tattoos as one of the ways to check anti-racist behavior. is that referring to all tattoos, or just tattoos portraying something that is part of a non-white culture? i'm a white passing jew and i was thinking of getting a tattoo at some point  but i don't want to if it's inappropriate for me to do so. (it would probably be in hebrew since it's culturally significant to me, if that matters)

answer: <p>lol</p>
<p>it is _always_ the tattooing that everyone ends up asking me about.</p>
<p>my answer...</p>
