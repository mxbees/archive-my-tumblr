question: If possible could you elaborate on the  reproductive rights tweet? I think I get what your saying but I'm not sure.

answer: <p>well...</p><p>there are many different ways that repo rights are relevant to trans women</p><p>the most relevant for me, is the fact that in many jurisdictions where you can change you documentation to match your lived gender, sterilization for trans women is generally a requirement, which, yeah, legally mandated sterilization of women is a repo justice issue.&nbsp;</p><p>there are other examples, but the sterilization issue is kind of a big one imo.&nbsp;</p>
