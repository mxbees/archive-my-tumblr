question: allergies are such an odd thing to discuss because so many people have them but people don't recognize them as a disability until they reach a threshold of "inconvenience" for other people. i've been living in my partners' apartment with them and their two other roommates for the past few months, but i'm almost confined to one room near the front door if i don't want to be sniffley, nauseated, and headache-y for hours after contact with the three animals in the house i'm allergic to.

answer: <p>yeahhhhh.</p><p>the unposted part of that essay is me exploring the issue of allergies as a disability in greater depth. i calculated how much money i spend to manage my allergies every year:</p><p>$850.</p><p>that is SO MUCH MONEY.</p>
