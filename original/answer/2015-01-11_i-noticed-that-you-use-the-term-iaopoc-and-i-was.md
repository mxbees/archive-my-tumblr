question: I noticed that you use the term "iaopoc" and I was wondering if you knew why this term exists as it does? I been tryna find info for months on who started this and why indigenous identity can be outside of POC (the "and/or") in a way that other racial identities aren't but I can't find anything. if it's not much trouble, I was wondering if you had any thoughts about that or if you could point me in the right direction. thanks!

answer: <p>i know that i picked up the 'iaopoc' from a friend, Frank E. i have no idea where Frank E got it from or the possible motivation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have my guesses...</p>
<p>i've also seen 'bipoc' = Black, Indigenous, and/or poc.</p>
<p>which is something i could use, although, i'm unclear why, if we are going to split it up like that we don't just name the three/four non-white races, since after "Black" and/or "Indigenous" we are only left with Asians as a race...</p>
