question: I know I've asked you this before, and you answered, but I can't find it. What books on logic and philosophy do you have and recommend for someone who wants more education on the terminology and articulated concepts?

answer: <p>i think the best thing for someone who just wants intro to the concepts and words (but with good overview), i think the</p><p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/">stanford encyclopedia of philosophy</a>&nbsp;</p><p>is a great place to start.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Since you can cross-reference any of the references made in a particular article, it is overall pretty useful. the specific entries are reasonably accessible, since they are written for a general audience (as you’d expect from an encyclopedia).&nbsp;</p><p>also... FREE. lol. and curated by stanford, so it is a pretty trustworthy resource.</p><p>importantly, they also have articles in non-white philosophy, which is pretty nice. like this article on <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mohism/">mohism</a>&nbsp;(written by a scholar who’s views i generally disagree with, but whatever).&nbsp;</p>
