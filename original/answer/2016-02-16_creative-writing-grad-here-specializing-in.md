question: creative writing grad here, specializing in nonfiction: most nonfiction resources suck as they're geared toward full-length memoirs or journalism and no in between. the best way to get better is to practice. experiment. get feedback. revise. experiment. get feedback. revise. if a piece isn't coming out right, leave it alone. if a piece is going great, keep it up. and, probably most importantly of all, read other nonfiction, especially styles you emulate, but really any and all reading is good.

answer: <p>*nods*</p><p>i do read nonfiction... but. yea. the little bit of googling i did made it pretty clear that nonfiction writing advice isn’t for me.</p><p>i want... to become better at writing *philosophy*. telling a narrative or painting a nice picture isn’t really a major concern for me.</p><p>above all... i really want my writing to be clear, lucid, concise, and easy to understand.&nbsp;</p><p>i guess what i really want is almost for my writing to.... disappear, so that ppl can focus on the ideas i’m trying to communicate.</p><p>one thing i’m also learning is that... book-length writing really isn’t my thing. i think i’m fairly good at maybe 4k to 5k words. enough space for me to really expand on an idea but not so long that loose focus.</p>
