question: (2) so I just wanted to ask if you'd be willing to either add more info/links to how sexism relates to EDs but that doesn't mean EDs are about appearance, or maybe just reword it to being about insecurities instead of specifically eating disorders? I know this was not at all a main/important part of the post, it just stuck with me for personal reasons so I figured I would at least ask.

answer: <p>hey.</p>
<p>just letting u and everyone else know that a footnote has been added for context on the eating disorder comment</p>
