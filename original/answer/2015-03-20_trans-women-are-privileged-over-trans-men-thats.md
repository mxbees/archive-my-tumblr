question: trans women are privileged over trans men, that's why they get more media attention, more representation (no matter how little it's still more than trans men) and it's because there is a mindset that men do everything better, including being a woman. There are hundreds of bullies on tumblr who go around saying they are "better women than cis women" and Laverne Cox literally had a tv show where she spoke about knowing how to be a woman better than cis women. Just stop.
