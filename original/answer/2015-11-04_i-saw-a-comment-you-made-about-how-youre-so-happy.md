question: I saw a comment you made about how you're so happy to be out of that scene.. How'd you get out?

answer: <p>i wish i could say that i have some awesome tale about how i learned to love myself and not crave the validation of white men. but. i’m really not that deep. or morally superior tbh.</p><p>the main reason i got out is bc i met someone and have been happily in a relationship for four and a half years now. while we did meet on okcupid, it isn’t something i’d be able to do now.</p><p>now? i’m wayyyyyyy to fucking femme for the scene. as little attention as i got before, i’d get even less now that i’ve gone full femme. theoretically, i could try and butch myself up again to get laid, but i don’t see the point.</p><p>even at my most butch i was still way too fucking femme for that crowd. and too asian. if i get tits at some point? yeah. not going to happen again.</p><p>and since i’d rather die alone than date a cishet man, that’s pretty much it. well.... i guess there’s trans men but my experiences dating them haven’t really been all that great.</p><p>also... now? i still can’t say i love myself too much to throw myself at white cis gays, i can say that i’ve learned enough about myself to know:</p><p>1. i don’t need sex</p><p>2. i barely need social interaction (at least in person).</p><p>between these two things, i can’t see me suffering through all the fucking bad dates, weeding through racists and transmisogynists, etc to ever bother with this again (should my current relationship ever end).</p><p>this is probably way longer and more rambling than you wanted,lol.</p>
