question: i don't think that's true. a lot of people who know they're disabled spend a lot of time suffering for it.

answer: <p>you utterly missed the point.</p><p>yes. now that i know that i’m disabled it isn’t like my life is magically easier or better. or like my disabilities have no impact on my life.</p><p>but knowing that i’m disabled has allowed me to escape the cycles of shame and despair over failing and failing and failing at life no matter how hard i tried.</p><p>and by that measure alone? its better. not perfect. not awesome. just better bc i don’t feel shame anymore.</p>
