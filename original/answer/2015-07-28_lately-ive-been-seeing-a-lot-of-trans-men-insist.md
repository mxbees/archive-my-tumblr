question: lately i've been seeing a lot of trans men insist that they don't have male privilege and just, what the hell?

answer: <p>*snorts*</p><p>it isn’t just lately. i mean... trans men have been pushing this for a long, long time. they usually rely on transmisogyny to establish their lack of male privilege.</p><p>but. yeah.</p><p>i mean, if the advocate’s series&nbsp;‘boys do cry’ is any indication, trans MRAs (men’s rights activists) are becoming mainstream in a way that wasn’t quite true before.&nbsp;</p><p>honestly. the rumblings of this have been around for a few years (ever since Janet Mock and Laverne Cox started to regularly make headlines). add on caitlyn jenner and...</p><p>we are starting to really see a backlash against trans women for our hypervisibility.&nbsp;</p><p>bc for a few years now, it has been an important part of activist performance to give lip service to the fact that twoc experience the most extreme levels of violence in the trans community. combined this with celebrities and the sensationalist media reports of twoc deaths...</p><p>and trans men are feeling like no one is paying attention to them. like they are erased.&nbsp;</p><p>and instead of diligently just talking about their experiences and problems, they are covertly (sometimes overtly) blaming trans women.&nbsp;</p><p>and so the end result is that for a few brief moments ppl pretended to care about twoc, as a whole, but very little of this translated to actual and real support. and now the new thing will be to talk about and make space for all the ~silenced~ and ~erased~ trans men who couldn’t or have been afraid to talk about their experiences bc of the awful male socialized, aggressive trans women who make everything about ourselves and refuse to listen.</p><p>remember: teh trans community is pretty much one of the few where&nbsp;‘what about teh menz?’ is considered a serious, critical question that we all ought to pay attention to.</p>
