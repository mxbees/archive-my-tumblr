question: What is "cis" such that it can be used as a designation, regardless of a person's identification? What, then, makes Aviance "cis"? That he's worked against TWOC (trans people do that all the time unfortunately)? That he is homonormative? That cissexism benefits him? What is the criteria for "cis," if I might ask?

answer: <p>hark!</p><p>behold, this is the sort of questions that one asks if one has become so deeply enmeshed in neoliberal identity politics that one has forgotten that&nbsp;‘cis’ and&nbsp;‘trans’ aren’t just about identity (or, arguable, never even about identity).</p><p>this question is only coherent and a sensible one to ask if u buy into a white framework of individualism such that individual identities override the systemic and institutional realities of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>when all of this becomes about what people feel about themselves and not, you know, about systems of power that privilege some and oppress others. that&nbsp;‘cis’ and/or&nbsp;‘trans’ is a mere action of individual will and desire, rather than the real and material lives of actual human beings in aggregate.&nbsp;</p><p>but let me say this much:</p><p>as an oppressed person, i name my oppressors. how they feel about being so named isn’t really something i give a flying fuck about. their desire to abdicate responsibility and complicity for how they oppress me, again, isn’t something i give a flying fuck about.&nbsp;</p><p>being named and designated as my oppressor makes them feel bad? good. i have no desire to make oppressors feel okay and comfy about standing on my back.&nbsp;</p><p>this isn’t a game i’m playing. i want freedom.&nbsp;</p>
