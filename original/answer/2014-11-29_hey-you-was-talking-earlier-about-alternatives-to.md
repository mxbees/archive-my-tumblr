question: Hey, you was talking earlier about alternatives to Tumblr, and I tried looking out for a bit, and found Diaspora* - have you heard about it? I'm currently looking into it, seeing how it works and stuff, and thought you could like to take a look on it

answer: <p>i do know about it and even have an account, i think.</p>
<p>i haven't spent too much time with it, though. i found it kind of confusing and as much as i like the idea, i don't think it is ever going to be a viable option, since i'm a pretty tech-savvy sort of person and i find the experience more than a little baffling, even as i actually understand the underlying tech and why it is so much better.</p>
