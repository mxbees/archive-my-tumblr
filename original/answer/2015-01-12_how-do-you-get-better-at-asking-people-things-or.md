question: How do you get better at asking people things or telling them to people? I am used to getting screamed at so I am really timid What do I do?

answer: <p>um...&nbsp;</p>
<p>i'm not really sure what this is actually asking. like. i do get being abused into being extremely conflict avoidant...&nbsp;</p>
<p>i also can't really comment too much if i don't know the context in which you'll be asking or telling? like. it depends.</p>
<p>idk. idk.</p>
<p>i feel like this is a question that ought to be asked to someone who is better at communicating than me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>like...</p>
<p>do i appear good at asking or telling stuff to ppl?</p>
<p>(if so, i'm a little surprised)</p>
