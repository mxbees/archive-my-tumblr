question: (same anon, you prolly know who i am bc of recent convos) i liked your response bc i agree with so much of it. 'i enjoyed slash (still do) but now women are making careers out of their homophobia?' THIS. and while most m/m authors i know of are female, there's a growing proportion of queer women writing the genre (mostly bc you can't make a living writing f/f) who take on those problems. it takes financial security and/or uncompromising morals to do so though, bc problematic stuff sells better.

answer: <p>*nods* totally.</p><p>(and yeah... i think i know who this is :P *waves*)</p><p>and it is super frustrating bc every time this convo comes around (which it does periodically), a lot of the self-defensive posturing is always&nbsp;“well, we write this for _us_ women, so men are oppressing us by telling us what we write is homophobic” and other unnuanced shit.&nbsp;</p><p>which is funny since many of the same ppl write fanfic and will swear up and down that authorial intent is irrelevant when it comes to interpreting and engaging a work... except that if you subject their work to a critical lens, suddenly they are relying on shit like&nbsp;‘authorial intent’ and intended audiences...</p><p>like. super awesome, you wrote this deeply homophobic book with two gay men as the main characters for other women.</p><p>and?</p><p>like. i read m/m probably for some of the same reasons that they write it: it is pretty nice to engage in a romance genre that isn’t dripping with misogyny (like het romance is). but swapping out misogyny for homophobia really isn’t an awesome solution.&nbsp;</p><p>and i’ll continue to give zero fucks about the 1-2 star reviews i leave with all the ppl who write gay cops and gay veterans. even though i know that this is a great selling and popular sub-genre.&nbsp;</p>
