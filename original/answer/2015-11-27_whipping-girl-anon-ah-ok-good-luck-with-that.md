question: (whipping girl anon) ah ok!! good luck with that, and obvi no rush or anything. i was just curious to see if it was still a possibility, not trying to pressure u into doing anything u don't want to/don't feel up to doing, thank u for the response!

answer: <p>its okay. i kind of do need a kick in the ass. esp. now that my meds have actually given me the spoons to do things. i should, um, catch up on all the shit i didn’t do over the past year while i was depressed and unmedicated.</p><p>originally, i wasn’t going to actually put it in print. but then i looked at where my royalties come from and i actually make way more from print than i thought i did. (not that i make a lot of money, mind you)</p><p>i guess ppl still really like buying paper books.&nbsp;</p><p>who knew?</p>
