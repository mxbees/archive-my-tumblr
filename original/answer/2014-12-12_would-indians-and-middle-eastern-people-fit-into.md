question: Would Indians and middle eastern people fit into "yellow"

answer: <p>yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>way back when... before the US reclassified the middle east as 'white'</p>
<p>they are still part of Asia.</p>
<p>and they def. were considered to be part of the 'yellow' race by white scientists/anthros/etc.</p>
