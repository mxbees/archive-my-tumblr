question: The anti asian asker: Thanks for your answer, the curt one and the long one. It's true I just thought, "Oh there's a specific term for black ppl so what's the terms for everybody else." but you're right. Not everybody needs a special term or needs everything black people got. I apologize to everybody, esp to black people for continuing the constant use of black ppl's struggle as model & measurement for everybody else's. Ima go do some reflecting.

answer: <p>you and me both since it is obvious from your ask u’ve been reading my posts about it and...</p><p>it think i’ve been exploring the idea a little too much myself.&nbsp;</p><p>so. for what its worth to everyone, i’m sorry too.</p>
