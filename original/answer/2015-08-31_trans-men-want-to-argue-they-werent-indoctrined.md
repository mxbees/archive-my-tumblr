question: Trans men want to argue they weren't indoctrined with the patriarchy but they demand that trans women kiss their ass and not express their justified anger towards the men who constantly silence and exploit them as if that isn't misogyny in it's finest which is a by product of our patriarchal society :)

answer: <p>right!?</p><p>its really this basic. <br></p><p>and acting like women magically get the power to silence and erase men just bc we are trans...</p><p>also classic transmisogyny on top of your regularly scheduled misogyny.</p><p>and not indoctrinated by patriarchy???</p><p>WHY ARE YOU LIKE ALL THE OTHER MEN?</p><p>and don’t tell me that ur doing it bc ur afraid of cis men bc... last time i checked, YOU AREN’T THE ONES CIS MEN ARE KILLING.<br></p>
