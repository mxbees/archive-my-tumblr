question: Please refer to my commentary on the post about Toronto pride trademarks and maybe edit the original post so misinformation doesn't get spread if you wouldn't mind. Thanks!

answer: <p>for everyone’s reference this is <a href="http://halflighttracing.tumblr.com/post/125218731331/b-binaohan-pride-toronto-has-applied-for">the commentary by halflighttracing</a>. <a href="http://bananapeppers.tumblr.com/post/125222386965/b-binaohan-pride-toronto-has-applied-for">bananapeppers also added this</a> (which extends the info).</p><p>anyway. i’m not editing the original post bc the original post is on twitter and you can’t edit tweets.&nbsp;</p><p>i also don’t particularly care if ~misinformation~ about toronto pride is spread around.&nbsp;</p><p>why? bc i don’t actually believe them. you’re more than welcome to do so, if this is what you want.</p><p>i don’t trust toronto pride. or any other pride organization in charge of the annual parades. i don’t trust the ppl who organize trans marches/prides either. don’t know anything about dyke march, so no comment.&nbsp;</p><p>the whole lot of them are usually fucked up white ppl who are assimilationist assholes. so.</p>
