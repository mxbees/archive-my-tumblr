question: " ‘cis’ and ‘trans’ aren’t just about identity (or, arguable, never even about identity)." can you talk about this some more? what are cis/trans if not identity? can a person be trans even if they don't identify as such?

answer: <p>well...</p><p>it depends on how you want to look at it. obviously, some people understand them as identity terms and this is what they are about on one level.</p><p>on a different level,&nbsp;‘trans’ denotes an oppressed class and&nbsp;‘cis’ denotes an oppressor class.&nbsp;</p><p>viewed from above (which is kind of a categorical power analysis) people can &nbsp;be and are cis and trans without identifying as such.</p><p>indeed, to answer you last question,&nbsp;‘transgender’ as conceived as a political umbrella term denoted and included people who rarely (if ever) actually identify as trans: straight male crossdressers, butch lesbians, femme gays, drag queens, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>these ppl were specifically and purposefully included under the trans umbrella because the ppl who pushed for the umbrella did feel that their&nbsp;‘gender non-conformity’ was indeed an aspect for how they experience oppression.&nbsp;</p><p>twenty some years later, the definition for&nbsp;‘trans’ (and thus,&nbsp;‘cis’) has obviously narrowed. however, even today, there are people pushed under the trans umbrella who might not want to be there. or may not necessarily belong.&nbsp;</p><p>but this shift in how many people use it, from political umbrella term to identity politics, is a great example for how the potential within naming an oppressed class (especially a name chosen by the people who belong to that class) becomes transformed within white liberal politics to become about individual feelings.&nbsp;</p><p>same thing happened with&nbsp;‘queer’, which was originally meant and intended to be used to signal _political_ affiliation and intention, rather than individual and personal identity. instead, nowadays we have people straightfaced arguing that&nbsp;‘queer’ isn’t a slur and that being ~queer~ isn’t about some experience of oppression.&nbsp;</p>
