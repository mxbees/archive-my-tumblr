question: The afab women. this isn't like an attack but a conversation for me to understand this issue further! The anon said some afab females were identifying as trans only because they're nb. But transsexual and transgender are two different terms, couldn't you be transgender if you are nb? Doesn't transgender imply gender fluidity?

answer: <p>ah.&nbsp;</p><p>um... i think there is some confusion</p><p>i had one anon saying some afab ppl were IDing as&nbsp;‘trans women’ and another said just&nbsp;‘trans’</p><p>afab ppl IDing as&nbsp;‘trans’ (either transgender or transsexual) is fine. afab ppl IDing as&nbsp;‘trans women’ is not fine.&nbsp;</p><p>(also...&nbsp;‘afab females’ is a terrible way to frame afab nb ppl)</p>
