question: I had not seen that post, thank you! I just. As I was reading their blog I had trouble understanding that someone actually 1. held those opinions and 2. didn't see how those opinions like, looped back around and basically destroyed everything they supposedly supported. (And I'm not well-educated on any of the related issues, so. ) It was like the Twilight Zone, except if the twilight zone was actually hell and everything was on fire.

answer: <p>hahahah</p>
<p>that is pretty much what engaging them is like...</p>
<p>serious exercise in futility (and frustration)</p>
<p>i applaud the ppl with the verve and energy to do so</p>
