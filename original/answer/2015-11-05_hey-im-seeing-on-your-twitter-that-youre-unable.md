question: Hey, I'm seeing on your twitter that you're unable to accept recent PayPal donations - as a person who donated, is there anything I can do to help? When I go to my PayPal, it says you "haven't accepted yet" and gives me an option to cancel... Should I cancel and donate to a different account? Or something? Just wondering how to help, if I can...

answer: <p>hey. yeah. totally cancel.&nbsp;</p><p>it was my fault. i didn’t change the email address, <a href="http://biyuti.com/donate">but this one is updated and works:</a></p><p>(i updated the&nbsp;‘long’ url behind the short one. ppl have told me that it works, so let me know if it doesn’t.)</p>
