question: I don't know what that says that I was expecting the antiblackness/racism to pop up as I was reading this eugenics thread but I guess, so much of it is implied. Everytime discussions around disability and eugenics pop up, I brace myself for the willful erasure of the widely accepted history of eugenics around race (especially all those instances of antiblackness that are ALSO perpetrated by POC) and the horrifying treatment of disabled POC, and especially disabled Black people.

answer: <p>YES.</p><p>like. as i was reading that post, i recalled two modern incidents of eugenics that, by and large, no one really cared about outside of the effected communities.</p><p>one is the recent incident of a large group of incarcerated Black women being forcibly sterilized.</p><p>the other is the recent stories of various Indigenous women being coerced into sterilization at hospitals, after they give birth.</p><p>like.</p><p>i don’t want to see any discussion about eugenics today that doesn’t talk about any of this.&nbsp;</p>
