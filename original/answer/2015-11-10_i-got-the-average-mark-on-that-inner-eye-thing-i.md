question: I got the average mark on that inner-eye thing. I do see images when reading or thinking, but not consistent or very detailed ones - not really faces or details, more like general outlines or kind of archetypal representations based on things I've seen in real life. And they're not a main focus for me - I still think far more in words than in pictures, and usually have to consciously try and conjure up imagery.

answer: <p>huh. yeah. this makes sense. although i think ur the first person i’ve talked with an&nbsp;‘average’ ability to make mental images.</p><p>although... tbh, i never really thought that there *was* a spectrum. i think i thought that it was either you saw stuff or you don’t. i never really thought that maybe people would have varying levels of detail and vividness to their mind images.&nbsp;</p><p>not surprising given my complete inability. but. yeah.</p>
