question: Thank you for your insightful post! I was wondering about the best ways I could go about reaching out to my school district and local women's shelters. Should I cold call my high school principal or should I aim higher? Should I ask to speak to the manager of the women's shelters or should I just go and talk in person? Any advice you could offer about this would be really really helpful.

answer: <p>Gosh. I really don't know. I'm a big fan of letting local people decide what tactics and stuff might work best in their respective contexts, since there are so many different ways to engage these kinds of things.</p>
<p>The first thing, of course, is individual ability. I don't want to advocate for specific methods bc not everyone can do any given thing and I don't want to discourage people from applying their creativity for finding solutions that'll work in their local context.</p>
<p>Like, if I say "yes, call people!" ... I mean, I get a lot of anxiety about phone calls and I def. don't want people to trigger panic attacks just bc I recommended that course of action. It could be that starting off with sending a letter might be the best way. Or volunteering (esp. with the women's services). But again, not everyone has the time for volunteering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I think that how people approach the women's services vs. the school district necessarily needs to be different. Like, I don't care so much about school admin getting bombarded with letters, phone calls, and whatever to change their policies, but that same level directed towards a woman's shelter could impact their ability to operate. And, even though many aren't inclusive, they are still necessary services and the people who run them tend to be continuously overworked as it is, dealing with a huge influx of people/letters/calls could impact their ability to serve women who need them.</p>
<p>I guess my only real advice is to start with research. Figure out what exists in your local area and who you need to contact. And get involved in way that you can re: ability and in the way that will have an impact but won't necessarily shut things down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be thoughtful and mindful and I totally think that these changes can happen.&nbsp;</p>
