question: I think you're actively confusing baeddels, who have been around for years and gender nihilism, which is really something that wasn't even given a name until May of this year. They are entirely two different communities and they actively hate each other. They don't agree on theory, gender nihilists believe baeddels are abusive and harbor rapists, and baeddels think gender nihilists are "CAFAB apologists." Baeddels are 2nd wave radfemmy, and gender nihilists reject the essentialism of radfeminism

answer: <p>i’m not confusing them and this is disingenuous.</p><p>i’ve been around long enough that i’m very well aware of how this discourse developed. i don’t know the details bc i don’t care to know. i wrote this all off when there was no distinction between the baeddles and nihilists (and, yes, i know that there was such a time bc this schism didn’t happen until this year).</p><p>nowadays, i do actually know that some of the nihilists are actually ppl i like and admire from a distance. whereas the group that split off into&nbsp;‘baeddles’ are ones i avidly do *not* like. indeed many of the nihilists are ppl i followed for years and only recently unfollowed bc of this exact issue (and others).</p><p>both groups, very recently, participated in some pretty fascinating identity policing that actually is what caused me to stop identifying as a twoc altogether. this is how much distance i’ve put between me and them.</p><p>maybe i’ve become so distanced that i actually can’t tell the difference between one fuzzy shape and another. i don’t really care.</p><p>i think my post aptly points out the ideological divide between us. our views are incompatible. i think they are wrong and they think i’m wrong. such is life.&nbsp;</p>
