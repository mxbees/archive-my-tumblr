question: a question on yr take on Gender Nihilism: i see an implication in there that structures of labor/social role divisions outside [christian/roman] europe shouldn't be (or can't be) mapped onto "gender" in the ways we usually do - just as other kinds of categories don't map onto european models (various versions of collectivity / community / peoplehood onto "nation", for instance). does that make sense to you in relation to bakla positions & other historic or current 'gender' stuff in the PH?

answer: <p>er... this isn’t something i meant to imply, but rather something i think that is implied by nihilism. i mean, my questions about a patriarchal society that divides labour into an oppressor class of men and an exploited class of women but is *not* capitalist, if such a society doesn’t have gender, what does it have? i think that one implication of gender nihilism is exactly as you say. that such a society doesn’t have gender. not in the way that they intend to abolish anyway.</p><p>which. of course. leads us to the question: how valuable of an ideology and praxis of gender liberation is nihilism if it can only remove *one* structure of gender-based oppression?</p><p>i mean. say that they are right. and say that they are successful in abolishing gender.</p><p>how do we deal with the cultures and societies where in oppressive, gendered divisions of labour weren’t entirely (or at all) dependent on either colonialism or capitalism?</p><p>or is what they mean to say, that anything other than what they narrowly define as gender isn’t oppression? like. you can have a patriarchal but non-capitalist society that exploits women but it isn’t oppression because there is no gender? or it is oppression, just not gender-based oppression?</p><p>but then what kind? a heretofore un-named oppression because it was hiding in the shadow of white supremacist captalist patriarchy?</p><p>not sure if this is actually clarifying or not, lol.</p><figure data-orig-height="251" data-orig-width="250"><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/10627d114c6cf5e7ee2e027959b76000/tumblr_inline_nxiedkvbcC1rdzs46_500.gif" data-orig-height="251" data-orig-width="250"></figure>
