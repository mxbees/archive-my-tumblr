answer: <p>yeahhhh.</p><p>i’m honestly not really liking it all that much. almost finished the first season and i don’t think i’ll continue.</p><p>my big issue these days is that i pretty much only want to watch cartoons. but i want more cartoons like adventure time or steven’s universe. when i try to google for recs, stuff like gravity falls pops up but....</p><p>so not the same. not even close.&nbsp;</p><p>i hate dipper so fucking much. actually stan too. but really dipper. and he’s like the main focus.</p><p>the whole wendy/dipper thing in the first season is.... gross on multiple levels. and it really squicks me.</p>
