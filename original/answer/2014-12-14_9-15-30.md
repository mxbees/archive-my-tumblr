question: 9, 15, 30

answer: <p>9. sex in a public place is... no. i guess. i mean. when i had sex in a library, it was after hours so while technically 'public' there was no public around.</p>
<p>15. answered in previous, and i'd give a 2nd most embarrassing thing but i don't really get embarrassed easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>30. yes. i watch porn.... :P</p>
