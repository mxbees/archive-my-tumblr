question: if you're concerned about writing style maybe finding someone to edit/beta-read your stuff might be helpful? that way your concerns are addressed w/o you having to do the editing yourself (since you mentioned it puts you to sleep to edit) tho fwiw i really like the conversational tone of your pieces, they're really helpful for understanding the issues at hand (will say that the only thing that throws me off is the grammar/typos bc i just tend to lose the whole sentence when that happens)

answer: <p>yeah. the grammatical mistakes and typos can be bad. although, i’m surprised i don’t make more errors considering that i literally do zero editing before posting.</p><p>i’m glad to hear, though, that someone likes my style... :D</p>
