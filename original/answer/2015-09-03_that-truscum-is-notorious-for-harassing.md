question: That truscum is NOTORIOUS for harassing anti-truscum/TPoC on tumblr. A friend of mine self harmed over his harassment. I'm honestly not surprised he responded to you with such drivel

answer: <p>i’m really sorry that your friend had to deal with this.</p><p>honestly? the only reason why i responded before blocking was as a way to point out how&hellip; coded and seemingly reasonable truscum/transbr0 MRAs sound like. </p><p>i mean&hellip; it started off really innocuous. i reasonable sounding scenario and then! i’m disregarding buddy’s experience, even though nothing was said about that. </p><p>my initial reply was ‘no’.</p><p>one of the best things about being on tumblr vs irl is that u can actually just block assholes without ever having to say a word with them.</p><p>don’t feel bad for blocking. block early and block often. </p>
