question: Have you ever read American Son by Roley? I'm not asking for a stamp of approval or recommendation (I'm reading it), just casual curiosity.

answer: <p>no, i haven't read it.</p>
<p>i just googled it and it kind of looks... terrible to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i hope it is actually better than it sounds.</p>
