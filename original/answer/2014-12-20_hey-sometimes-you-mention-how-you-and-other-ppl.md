question: Hey, sometimes you mention how you and other ppl like so treu or bad dominicana are on the cutting edge of theory. correct me if i'm wrong, but most of these conversations are on twitter? I really appreciate how you post your tweets here (as im not on twitter) and were wondering if the other ppl you often mention/credit/cite have a tumblr (or other such place) where their tweets are filtered through. Assuming they're ok with you sharing links to their sites, i'd love to follow their words.

answer: <p>huh. i actually just turned off the thing that pipes my tweets into tumblr bc...idk. i thought maybe ppl found them annoying but i turned it back on just for u.</p>
<p>both <a href="http://so-treu.tumblr.com">so_treu</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://bad-dominicana.tumblr.com">bad-dominicana</a> have tumblrs. although, admittedly, they don't update often and they don't collect/archive their tweets often (like in storifys or whatnot).</p>
<p>unfortunately... i don't think there is any other way that reading their twitter TLs do read their current stuff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>while i do know of ways to circumvent this restriction, i'm not really willing to put them out here bc the choice of twitter as medium is deliberate.* like... the ppl who've abandoned tumblr and other longer form blogging platforms in favour of microblogging like twitter is deliberate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>one of the... frustrations and strengths of twitter is that tweets, in a very real sense, are ephemeral. twitter's search api only goes back about a week or so. of course, if you are directly on the person's twitter profile, you can scroll back further than a week (sometimes) but there are limits. you wouldn't be able to go back say, five months, on anyone's TL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is a strength bc it places more control in the hands of the individual tweeter what happens with their data and how ppl are able to interact with it. since the blocking feature works much more thoroughly on twitter than tumblr.&nbsp;</p>
<p>it is an act of... agency and individual boundary setting that they've chosen their medium and that, if you do want to read the amazing stuff they write, you have to engage them where they are. which i know isn't very comforting particularly if you have trouble learning new/adapting to environments (which is true of a lot of ppl i care deeply about which is part of why i have my tweets piping into tumblr... and it is also an act of self-archiving on my part, since twitter's archiving service can be unreliable).&nbsp;</p>
<p>i know that this isn't probably very useful info for u... but i guess i can't really do more? maybe just check out their profiles once in a while and read through their TLs?</p>
<p>*also twitters own API rules make extracting data (which is tweets) from the service a lot more difficult than used to be true, so circumventions can also violate not only their own boundaries but Twitter's terms of service....</p>
