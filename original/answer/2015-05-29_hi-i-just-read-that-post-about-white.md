question: Hi, I just read that post about white philosophy... and I think that it is so important. It made me want to go and read all of your other writings, but I just wanted to make sure that was okay with you first. Sometimes people have limitation on who they want viewing their blog, and I'm always worried that I'm trespassing. Thanks!
