question: 1) On the topic of whether the cultural or the legal domain defines who is white…I’m not as educated on the matter as you, and I have no personal opinion either way - but I have some questions after reading your post. I understand the points you make. But still. If the legal and political domain defines who is and isn’t white… How does that apply to countries where legal discrimination has been based on ethnicity and religion, and not race? ->

answer: Ah. See, the context of where I’m writing matters. I think that only in the US does policy and legal stuff matter re: whiteness. Because they are (as far as I know) the only country in the world that currently has legal precedents determining who is and who isn’t white. Like. Right now, the US has Supreme Court decisions that I don’t think have been challenged or overturned, that have determined that Indians, Chinese, and Japanese people are white. I really can’t think of any other country that has had actual cases like this.</p><p>Most european nations haven’t need to legally define whiteness because it has always been 1000% clear who is and who isn’t white in europe. And, yes, this is legally determined too. In Europe where nationalism does have a big impact on discrimination and such, it isn’t interesting how they managed to draw the boundaries for the European ‘continent’ just so that it excludes all the Black, Brown, and Yellow people?</p><p>They didn’t need to enshrine this in law because it was already clearly determined by custom and then later, by the geo-political boundaries they drew.<br></p><blockquote><p>2) My country for example has not had any race policies like the US. 
Does that mean it has been racial equality heaven? Definitely not. The 
attitudes are/have been similar, but the laws have not. So how is it 
laws, and not culture that determines who is a person of color? And how 
do old American race policies specifically determine who is to be 
considered a person of color everywhere else? -&gt;</p></blockquote><p>Why do old American laws matter for everywhere else? In part, see above with US courts actually determining who is and who isn’t white. But also because racism/white supremacy is a global ideology that has always been global in scope.</p><p>Looking at American policy and law matters because they formally worked out the boundaries of whiteness that the rest of the world (esp. Europe) had basically worked out by custom and culture. And... <br></p><p>Look. This isn’t variable by geography. Do you know that as late as 1933 they were using Johann Blumenbach’s classic 1795 treatise that established scientific racism as evidence in US supreme court cases? Do you know where Blumenbach is from? Germany. The US formally (in laws and policy) implemented <i>European</i> ideas. <br></p><p>And my argument isn’t that laws (instead of culture) determines who is white. It is white supremacy who decides this. <br></p><blockquote><p>3)
 Do you mean that because the US was founded by white colonialists on 
white supremacist ideals, that the laws and policies regarding race that
 existed in the US are a good *indicator* of who can be considered white
 and who can be considered a person of color in a global context? That 
would make sense to me. -&gt;</p></blockquote><p>No. See above. US policies make clear the _global_ construction of whiteness. White supremacy has always been about all people everywhere with very little variation amongst geography. This, ultimately, is the point I’m making. Looking at the US makes things easier because they literally put down what everyone else was doing on paper. The white supremacy and racism enshrined in US law <i>comes from Europe</i>. It is exactly the same racism and white supremacy that exists in Europe, because it is based on an ideology created by white Europeans. <br></p><blockquote><p>4) Those who claim the Irish weren’t considered white – are most of them
 perhaps Europeans? If there have been no laws that discriminate against
 people on the basis of not being white, then it is easier to see all 
kinds of lower status ethnic and religious groups as being people of 
color, even those that don’t look different from groups considered 
white. (And this of course helps if you don't like that people who look 
like you are always the bad guys.) -&gt;</p></blockquote><p>I have no idea about the national origin of many of the ‘irish were white’ people. I’m pretty sure some are Americans. At the very least, many are scholars of American history and/or race. The problem with this, is that the idea has become ubiquitous in racial discourse.</p><p>What people seem to miss out on is that the discrimination and oppression between different white groups existed _before_ racism. And, because racism turned out to be such a powerful discourse, they later attempted to shovel in older religious-ethnic prejudice into racial discourse. And, for a while, they succeeded. This is where Nordicism came from and how some white ppl became targets in the eugenics movement. <br></p><blockquote><p>5) Btw I’ve noticed that the ethnic groups considered white in 
modern/early modern times correspond to the groups that were Christian 
during medieval times, minus Ethiopians. If during colonialism religion 
had remained the measure of who is "civilized" and who is not, then 
colonized people would have been entitled to their full humanship (or as
 much of it as class and gender allowed) as soon as they had become 
converted to Christianity, which would have been inconvenient for the 
colonial powers.</p></blockquote><p>The interesting thing, especially, is that a lot of people really 
don’t seem to understand what it meant for racism to be a _science_. 
White people, for many hundreds of years, truly believed that 
racism/white supremacy was an objective fact of reality. What this 
means, though, is that Blumenbach’s treatise was considered 
authoritative for a very, very long time. And most people, after he 
wrote, oriented their racial discourse around his treatise.</p><p>But... he created a problem for whiteness because his boundaries for caucasian/white were much, much broader than anyone was actually comfortable with (white for him is literally all of Europe -- minus the Saami -- all of the middle east/west Asia, parts of central Asia, south Asia, and north Africa). <br></p><p>Which means that whiteness actually covered a bunch of different religious groups, since the region covered by whiteness for him is really fucking diverse in both religion, culture, and colour.</p><p>And the centuries following Blumenbach were people trying to find scientific reasons for why some white people aren’t as great as other white people, but they didn’t fundamentally question the distinction because they thought it was a factual facet of reality. <br></p><p>(Of course, like all science there wasn’t a universal consensus on this, which is why no one ever -- despite their inclusion -- thought that south Asians, and the central Asians included, were white. But there is still a US supreme court case that formally says that while Indians are caucasian, they still aren’t white -- or something to this effect). <br>
