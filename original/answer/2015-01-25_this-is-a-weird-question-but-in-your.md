question: This is a weird question, but in your research/general experience, is spanking your children as a primary mode of discipline generally considered abusive? I don't mean using spanking as a last resort for dangerous situations, I mean more like... spanking for not cleaning up a bedroom or getting up during naptime. (obvs pls don't feel obligated to answer this, I'm just asking you specifically because you really know your shit on most subjects)

answer: <p>the answer for this is... complicated. bc everyone seems to have a lot of really strong opinions.</p>
<p>but... focusing on your keywords here 'primary mode of discipline' make me say, yes, this is abusive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i mean, whatever ppl's individual beliefs about spanking or corporal punishment, hitting your kid (and spanking IS hitting) for literally EVERY THING they do wrong screams abuse to me. bc... what happens when the spanking stops being effective? it seems like a situation that will inevitably escalate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>like. i was spanked. but it was sparingly. and my dad stopped doing it once it stopped being effective (as in, once i stopped crying when it happened). i don't consider myself to have been physically abused as far as that is concerned... but it did set a precedent with may dad for when i was older. as in, after the spanking stopped, if i happened to make my dad really really mad, he would hit me (like a punch to the face/body, a slap, something). _this_ was definitely abusive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>on a more general note, i do think that hitting kids is never a good option as discipline/punishment. it isn't effective and (if there is such a line at all and i'm not convinced that there is) the line between 'discipline' and 'abuse' when it comes to corporal punishment is really really fucking thin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>and imo the situation you describe crosses that line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>oh. last comment, you should also look up the laws in the jurisdiction where this is happening because in some places, any hitting of your kid is considered abuse. some places that don't outright say that striking children is bad always, will set out some guidelines for 'appropriate' spanking. it might help u figure it out.&nbsp;</p>
