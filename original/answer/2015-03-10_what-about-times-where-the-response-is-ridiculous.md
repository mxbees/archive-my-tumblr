question: what about times where the response is ridiculous to young teens? there was an incident where a 13 y old got death and sexual threats from dozens and dozens of adults bc she said something like "gays are weird"

answer: <p>what does this have to do with her being a teen?</p><p>literally _no one_ deserves or should be getting rape and death threats.</p><p>remember: we were talking about tumblr sj.&nbsp;</p><p>anti-sj ppl have gone on _record_ to admit that they send threats under the guise of being sj for the sole purpose of making ppl look bad.&nbsp;</p><p>sending rape and death threats is 10000000% unacceptable no matter what the age of the recipient is and this is a problem that has nothing to do with age.&nbsp;</p>
