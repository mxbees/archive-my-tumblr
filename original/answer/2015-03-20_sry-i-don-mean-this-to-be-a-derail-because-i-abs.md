question: sry, i don mean this to be a derail (because i abs agree obvs that trans men are privileged over trans women) but it might be anyways... i have the fortune of not having interacted much with TERFs and couldn't find anything explicit online - *would* a trans man be accepted at vrr with any degree of respect, or would it be contingent on him accepting being gendered as a woman? "you get treated better if you lie" - ppl say that about trans women ("just present as a man = profit") and its bullshit.

answer: <p>vancouver rape relief basically has a&nbsp;‘womyn born womyn’ policy derived from radfem politics.</p><p>which means they believe that trans men are really women and trans women are really men. so, yeah, it would be contingent on him accepting this misgendering. which is shitty in its own way. just... not the same as being entirely bared (with no recourse) from one of the few rape crisis centres in Vancouver.</p><p>just like trans men can openly go to michfest and access many other kinds of&nbsp;‘womens’ services.&nbsp;</p><p>also... vancouver rape relief is 10000% against sex workers. just felt like this is important to remember.&nbsp;</p>
