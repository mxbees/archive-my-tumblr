question: Hi! I understand if you want to stop posting yr tweets here, but I really appreciate that you do. I don't have very much reason to go on twitter. Nbd if you do decide to stop though, I'll just have to start logging in over there more often :)

answer: <p>ah. the tweets are probably still going to come in. i'm just not sure that i'll be putting my long posts on tumblr anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>like this was never my main blog and.... i only starting crossposting my blogs posts to tumblr bc ppl indicated that they'd prefer this. but.</p>
<p>not sure i care about that anymore. like. ppl will still get notified of new posts via twitter (which will get piped to tumblr)... so. yeah. idk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>we'll see...</p>
