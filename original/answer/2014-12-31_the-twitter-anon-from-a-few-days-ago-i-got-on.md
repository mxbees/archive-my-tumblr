question: The twitter anon from a few days ago: I got on twitter and followed people and oh my god how do people do it? The feed updates every few minutes and everything's chaotic and in pieces and how how how. So now I just have to doubly thank you for filtering your tweets to tumblr.

answer: <p>lol. twitter can be like that. really overwhelming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>here are a general principle that i use for to make dealing with twitter easier:</p>
<p>- on twitter i find it easier to let go of the notion that i have to read _everything_ on my timeline. it is impossible. there are too many tweets and they update too quickly. so i don't try and i actually find this less stressful than tumblr where i'm always feeling like i need to make sure that i've seen every single post on my dash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>here is how i manage twitter:</p>
<p>NEVER USE THE TWITTER.COM WEB CLIENT/INTERFACE</p>
<p>now. its been a while since i used it myself. but. whenever i look at it now it is even more confusing to me since they attempted to organize your timeline to make following threads and convos easier. before. twitter.com used to present its timeline like tumblr: strict chronological order from newer to older.&nbsp;</p>
<p>but the great thing about twitter over tumblr is that you don't _have_ to use the twitter.com interface. at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>twitter itself offers a different web UI called <a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/">tweetdeck</a>. this is intended for 'power users' bc it allows you to log into more than one twitter account at a time.</p>
<p>it presents its info in series of column (that you pick) that contain different kinds of information:</p>
<p><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/adbb8ac873a9c1239acfab0d138f422a/tumblr_inline_nhg65rIOIe1rdzs46.png" /></p>
<p>here you can see that i have my timeline (column: home) and my mentions side by side. clicking on an individual tweet will show you any replies.</p>
<p>my favourite thing about tweetdeck is that you can filtre each of the columns. you'll note that my home column has a 'filtered by:' thing there. i turn off retweets so that i only see original tweets from all the people i follow. this cuts down A LOT the amount of stuff i see. you can also filter out certain hashtags that are popular (like if you want to avoid spoilers for a show)</p>
<p>for myself, i only use this for following conversations bc my favourite twitter client (<a href="https://github.com/dialelo/turses">turses</a>) doesn't update in real time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>twitter also really shines in mobile. since it was really the first mobile-focused social network, there are a lot of different ios or android mobile clients for you to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>however, if you use third party clients (i hate the official twitter app, just like i don't like the official twitter website), it can cost money for an ad free version OR you can bump into the max 100,000 users rule (twitter only allows 3rd party clients to have that many users bc they want everyone to use their shitty official apps).&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you're on android, one of my favourite apps is <a href="http://getfalcon.pro/">falcon</a>. it once cost money and was so popular that they hit the 100,000 limit really fast. they've now open sourced the app and give it away for free <a href="http://lifehacker.com/bypass-falcon-pros-twitter-token-limit-with-this-chea-754679503">with a hack</a> to overcome the limit. the hack takes a few extra steps but it isn't super hard or anything.</p>
<p>so i just dumped a bunch of info on you, but i hope this makes your twitter experience a bit friendlier...&nbsp;</p>
<p>oh. and if other ppl want to pipe their tweets into tumblr, i use <a href="https://ifttt.com/">ifttt</a>&nbsp;for this. actually. people should use ifttt anyway since it is this sort of service that allows you to connect a bunch of different things to share info. like. i use ifttt to crosspost my blog posts to tumblr.&nbsp;</p>
