question: I know you've talked about this before but are middle eastern people poc or just ethnic whites? if they're ethnic whites, should they still be included in discussions of racism because of how orientalism specifically targets them?

answer: <p>i had something much longer written but... this is such a contentious issue that all i’m going to do is relate <a href="http://debbiejlee.com/ageofwonder/blumen.pdf">Blumenbach’s racial theory</a>, here’s who he thought was white people:</p><blockquote><p><i>Caucasian variet</i>y. Colour white, cheeks rosy (s. 43); hair brown or chestnut-coloured (s. 52); head subglobular (s. 62); face oval, straight, its part moderately defined, forehead smooth, nose narrow, slightly hooked, mouth small (s. 56). The primary teeth placed perpendicularly to each jaw (s. 62); the lips (especially the lower one) moderately open, the chin full and rounded (s. 56). In general, that kind of appearance which, according to our opinion of symmetry, we consider most handsome and becoming. To this first variety belong the inhabitants of Europ (except the L*pps and the remaining descendants of the Finns) and those of Eastern Asia, as far as the river Obi, the Caspian Sea and the Ganges; and lastly, those of Northern Africa.</p></blockquote><p>I did manage to find a handy colour coded map for this, except it was too inaccurate so I coloured in my own map, lol (if ppl repost this image, maybe give me credit?):</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="625" data-orig-width="1425"><img src="https://36.media.tumblr.com/91823ee575e15c15083e414c1701cc5f/tumblr_inline_ntdrsknHKn1rdzs46_540.png" data-orig-height="625" data-orig-width="1425"></figure><p>This is the world divided by races as seen by blumenbach (who is the person responsible for popularlizing caucasion and a significant figure in the history of scientific racism). At this point in the history of scientific racism, there is no difference between&nbsp;‘white’ and&nbsp;‘ethnic white’. Just white.</p><p>This situation was obviously untenable given the cultural differences (the above distinction is based purely on ~science~ without respect for culture). Which of course gave rise to nordicism, which split&nbsp;‘white people’ into subraces and considered only the north and west europeans as the Good Whites.</p><p>Which white subraces actually exist depends on who you read, but the important point is that only north and west europeans are the Good Whites (this does not, of course, include Jewish people who might be living in those areas -- what matters is where your ppl come from or are perceived to have come from, not where they actually live).&nbsp;</p><p>I know this doesn’t quite answer your question, but I’m not really comfortable discussing it beyond relating the historical theory of one (very influential) crusty old white german d00d.</p><p>You’ll have to make your own conclusions. I know what mine are, in general. But I’ll keep that to myself.&nbsp;</p>
