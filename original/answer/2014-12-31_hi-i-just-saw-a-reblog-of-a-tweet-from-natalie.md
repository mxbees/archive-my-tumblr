question: Hi, I just saw a reblog of a tweet from Natalie Reed, where you had commented that she's a racist. I have no intention of questioning that or defending whatever she did but I would be willing to use whatever slight acquaintance I have with her through FB (I actually haven't seen any of her posts in ages) to try to discuss it with her & hopefully to help educate her, if you think that has any hope of a desirable outcome. Is it ok to ask what she did, or would it be better to just leave her to it?

answer: <p>meh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't bother. if she remembers me at all, she'll remember what happened between us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>when it happened i called her out directly for her shit and she whitesplained all over my blog.</p>
<p>she isn't interested in accountability, liek most white ppl.</p>
