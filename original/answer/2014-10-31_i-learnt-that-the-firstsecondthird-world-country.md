question: I learnt that the first/second/third world country terminology came about to differentiate between those who allied with the US in the Cold War.  Regardless if that's true or not, why is a white woman suddenly trying to dictate what the terms mean???  There is obviously racism tied to the terminology (a lot of countries popularised by mainly PoC are "third world" for_some_ reason) so I really don't see why her input is needed or seen as right?

answer: <p>yes yup. you got it.</p>
<p>to the extent that her input is needed&nbsp;</p>
<p>(which is not at all)</p>
<p>it is a pretty curious thing for a white woman living in the 'developed'/'first world' to be acting like she has some place to talk about how countries living in the socalled 'developing'/'third world'/'global south' should be okay with referring to themselves.</p>
<p>like. i live in canada. while i'm part of a diaspora, i don't think it is my place even in the slightest to be telling people back home (the PH) how they ought to be referring to themselves conceptually to the rest of the world. even more so, i would sure as fuck not sit here on stolen land telling ppl struggling anywhere in the world but especially poc countries and all Indigenous ppls (including those who livei n the ~developed~ countries like canada) what the 'better' theoretical framework is for discussing themselves in relation to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>now, if i have only the most tenuous and fairly inconsequential claim on being in a position of authority to say "this means this" and "this term is better than that one"</p>
<p>what can we call the entitlement of a white women living on settled/stolen land, who refuses to mark her race on her blog for ~aesthetic~ reasons, who thinks that her opinion on how countries ravaged by colonialism and white supremacy is somehow wanted or relevant?</p>
<p>at the end of the day, she is just another white woman who needs to deal with the fact that she is a cracker and should keep her mouth shut on matters where she is the oppressor.</p>
