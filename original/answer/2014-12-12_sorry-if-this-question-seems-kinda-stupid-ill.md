question: Sorry if this question seems kinda stupid.  I'll admit I'm developmentally disabled so some discourse doesn't register to me fully right away;  But uhm, I'm trying to think about your discussion on the racial hierarchy but I'm still trying to figure out exactly where Latinx people fit into the mix?  Like for example Latinx ppl are paid less overall that black people (according to studies on the wage gap) so should they be the lowest of the low? (1/*)

answer: <p>latin@ isn't a race... so they don't fit anywhere on the racial hierarchy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>you're being too literal re: the stats...</p>
<p>these are conceptual/scientific/social categories created by white ppl for things like eugenics/population control/legal categories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>if we're talking the US, 'latin@' (or 'hispanic' as it is on the census) is an ethnicity, so you can check 'white' for your race and 'hispanic' for your ethnicity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>so when u look at stats like that...</p>
<p>you have to realize that within the 'Latin@s are paid the lowest' this actually includes:</p>
<p>- White latin@s</p>
<p>- Black latin@s</p>
<p>- Indigenous latin@s</p>
<p>- Asian latin@s</p>
<p>- mixed race Latin@s</p>
<p>so you can't say 'latin@s' are paid less than Black ppl because these aren't mutually exclusive categories</p>
