question: i was looking a week ago at your patreon and i was looking now and forgive me but did the page change? it looks like it did but i have a lot of memory issues and wanted to check

answer: <p>yes!</p><p>it did change. the main thing is that i switched to a monthly donation cycle bc...</p><p>well, being depressed for the past 8 months has really cut into my productivity and ability to write and tying the donations to my productivity was kind of a bad idea.&nbsp;</p><p>i also changed up some of the perks/rewards, bc of this.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/shift-to-monthly-3121245">i describe most of this and the reasoning behind the change in this post.</a></p>
