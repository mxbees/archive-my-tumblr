question: Orion: Favourite month? , Hercules: Favourite instrument? , Pegasus: Favourite place to be? , Cygnus: Favourite weather? Hydra: Favourite sound?

answer: <p>Orion: um... idk? i’ve never really thought about. but. let’s go with april bc that’s when my anniversary is.</p><p>hercules: my fav instrument is the piano. just about the only instrument that can actually get me to cry.</p><p>pegasus: my favourite place to is at home.... but i guess that’s a little obvious since i’m agoraphobic.&nbsp;</p><p>cygnus: favourite weather... i’m torn between sweater weather in the fall or spring. maybe fall bc there is no dog poo smell.</p><p>hydra: favourite sound... gosh. my mind goes directly to music but i guess this isn’t quite what it means. i’ll go with laughter.</p>
