question: i'm the same way. i can write essays well enough, but memoirs or anything like that is not my speed. i blame the autisms that keeps me from knowing how much detail to add, so we add none. still, if that's the style you're going for, are there writers that you like? are there more than one? if copying style's a concern, try deliberating copying a style and then revise it so it reflects yours. forces you to make a difference.

answer: <p>hmm... maybe. i tried to start a memoir a few years ago but... i only recently learned why that was doomed to failure and its bc i have very little&nbsp;‘autobiographical memory’ lol.&nbsp;</p><p>a memoir from me would be boring bc there’d be so little detail and emotional content to my stories. and too few of them.</p>
