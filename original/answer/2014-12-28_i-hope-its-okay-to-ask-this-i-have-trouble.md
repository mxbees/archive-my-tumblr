question: I hope it's okay to ask this. I have trouble understanding some academic concepts but I think I'm understanding most of your amazing posts on the subject. I'm a white nonbinary person and I'd like to know how to reduce the harm I cause by ID'ing as nb, aside from doing things like avoiding tokenizing IAOPOC and explicitly reifying transmisogyny, discussing gender-neutral bathrooms/ID markers without centring trans women, etc. Thank you for your time!

answer: <p>i'm going to answer this question bc i feel like it. but it isn't technically ok to ask me to do the heavy lifting for u. i'm not sure u (and others) quite get how hard it is for me to articulate and formulate my thoughts about gender re: iaopoc and try and work towards our liberation, much less solving the problems of white ppl too.</p>
<p>speaking for myself... i'm not sure there is any way for white nb ppl to articulate their identities that doesn't reinforce white supremacy. this would be like trying to articulate a coherent identity as a white person under white supremacy. being white is inextricably bound to white supremacy since they were created at the same time. you cannot be coherently white outside of a white supremacist framework. likewise, white trans ppl are inextricably bound within a system that privileges them and allows them to articulate their identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i also want to be clear: it isn't your simple existence that causes harm, but relationships of power that embed your existence within a larger social structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>identity is simply who you are.... and there aren't any bodies that are necessarily good or evil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>my issue with white nonbinary ppl isn't that you exist or that you identify in this way or that (so long as it isn't in appropriative ways)</p>
<p>but in the ways that you articulate your experiences under cisnormativity/cissexism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>essentially, my real big issue is white nonbinary exceptionalism. it is the ahistorical and hegemonic ways that you craft and create your discourse (esp. as it involves explicit political aims).&nbsp;</p>
<p>for me, it is these moves and such that move any given white nonbinary person (or the poc who willingly buy into the exceptionalism) from the default, passive complicity in white supremacy to being overt, active participants/architects.</p>
<p>and while the message that the best &nbsp;you might hope for is 'passive complicity' this is rather the way that oppression works, since they are institutions, not about individual actions as such.</p>
<p>this is something literally everyone has to struggle, since there are so many different, overlapping kinds of oppression that we are all complicity in some way</p>
<p>(for example: i am and will always be complicity in anti-Blackness. i am and always will be -- so long as i live where i do -- complicit in Indigenous genocide as a settler. these are simple facts about me. even though, yeah, i try to do what i can to dismantle these things and to not be an active and willing participant in other ppl's oppression, it isn't possible until the institutions themselves are utterly destroyed.</p>
<p>in a different way... this is always the problem i have with any white person (or similarly privileged person) who comes into my ask box with question like yours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>always seeking some kind of... formula or recipe for how to absolve yourself from accountability. when it simply isn't possible...</p>
<p>but yeah. i did answer this question bc it was specifically about harm reduction, rather than absolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>the harm caused by white nb ppl can be reduced if you avoid buying into white nb exceptionalism. it isn't the only way. but it would help.)</p>
