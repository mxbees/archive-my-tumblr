question: Have you heard about the whole affair surrounding Andrea Smith? This is the first time I've seen other indigenous/Native scholars speak out against her...I guess I haven't been paying attention for as long. It's such a shame because Conquest was really one of the works first I encountered that helped me as a primer for *that* kind of work/area of study, but now it definitely feels like she Tim Wise-d her way into her academic/activist position :/

answer: <p>i did hear about it but am not commenting bc i’m not Indigenous.</p><p>like. i’m not an academic so i’ve only read an article or two from her, but i was already starting to walk away from her work bc of how she talks about anti-Blackness (like in Jared Sexton’s recent article).&nbsp;</p><p>beyond that... i’m mostly keeping my thoughts to myself.&nbsp;</p>
