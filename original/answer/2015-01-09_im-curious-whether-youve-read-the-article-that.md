question: I'm curious whether you've read the article that says that Irish people weren't actually victimized in the ways they claim they were, to the point of the "no Irish need apply" signs being a myth. It's under my /tagged/irish. It seems to tie in with the white myth of victimization in general so I thought you might be interested.

answer: <p>i don't think i read that particular one, but i did skim one article whose purpose was to debunk the notion of 'irish slavery' in the colonies and how indentured servitude was like, utterly and completely different from chattel slavery. or any kind of actual slavery.&nbsp;</p>
