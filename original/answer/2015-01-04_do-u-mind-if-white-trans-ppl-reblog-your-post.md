question: do u mind if white trans ppl reblog your post about those two posts u reblogged?

answer: <p>i would actually prefer it if white trans ppl _did_ reblog that post.</p>
<p>i mean... the general ignoring of the problem of anti-Blackness in the white trans community is a big problem</p>
<p>so. yeah. do reblog.</p>
