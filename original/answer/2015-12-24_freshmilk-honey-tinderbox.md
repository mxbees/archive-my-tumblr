question: freshmilk, honey, tinderbox

answer: <p>freshmilk:&nbsp;</p><p>omg. i’m 32 (momentarily had to calculate the year, but yes. 32)</p><p>honey:</p><p>nicknames.... um. not really? nicknames (other than a shortened version of my deadname) don’t really stick to me. the closest i can think of is that my bro has taken to calling me&nbsp;‘babe’ in retaliation for calling him&nbsp;‘bro’.</p><p>tinderbox:</p><p>why are you all picking things that’ll mean me talking about my relationship? i cherish my relationship/partner the most.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>(and now you are all learning what an awful sappy, cheesy human i am)</p>
