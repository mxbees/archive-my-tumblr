question: hi! If I may ask, do you think homophobia, transphobia and transmisogyny are related? Or do you think they're separate concepts entirely?

answer: <p>i tend not to think much about transphobia, beyond wondering if it actually exists (i think cissexism and transmisogyny exist. such that trans men are impacted by cissexism but not transmisogyny and that trans women obvs. experience both and i'm not sure i think that transphobia exists as a distinct thing, since almost all of the examples of transphobia i have ever seen generally happen to only trans women and usually only really happen to twoc... so yeah. and what doesn't only happen to twoc can be explained by cissexism)</p>
<p>i think homophobia (but i prefer to talk about heterosexism or, better yet, heteronormativity) is distinct but related.&nbsp;</p>
