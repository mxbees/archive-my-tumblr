question: Your vocalization of the experiences that twoc like myself have is very much appreciated. Just know that I always look forward to your ramblings lol. One of the few tumblr bloggers with sj content that is not afraid to be unpopular. I wish you well!!

answer: Wow. Thanks so much. This is a really meaningful thing for me to hear right now at this very moment.

It just gets so frustrating talking about this stuff and feeling like no one listens or cares. 
And...  Yeah. I don't really care about being popular. I'm actually far far less popular than most ppl usually assume. Like. I often get the impression that ppl think that I have thousands of followers when I really really don't.

Anyway. Thank you so much. This is the sort of thing I really needed to hear tonight. I do what I do for you and all other twoc.
