question: excited about the prospect of videos! (and glad you'll be captioning, so many people dgaf about access)

answer: <p>yeah. for videos i post? ive always captioned them and provided transcripts.</p><p>actually one of the reasons i donâ€™t do much of them is bc captioning is pretty difficult for me (for a variety of reasons)</p><p>on the rare occasion, i will caption other popular videos that i think are really important.&nbsp;</p><p>(once upon a time, i was actually getting paid to caption video until they... simply stopped assigning me projects and answering my emails. that part was shitty.)</p>
