question: can you help me understand what's wrong with darkmatter? i'm not a stan but i've liked what i've read/heard of them so far. i've only heard on tumblr that they are problematic/antiblack but i can't find receipts (i just find things about the universe... lol). thank you! whether you have the capacity to respond or not, thank you for your blog. i've learned so much :)

answer: <p>normally..... i would answer this.&nbsp;</p><p>however... i promised myself that in 2016 i’d be naming no names bc i don’t want to get sued again.<br></p><p>sorry.&nbsp;</p>
