question: all your comments on gravity falls in particular but also seeking animated shows in general are 10000% how i feel trying to get into new shows. it feels extra frustrating too with any media that supposed to be made for children because people are that much quicker to dismiss critiques, like "oh but it's just for kids/kids dont think about it that way". it's like, that's the point: they might not now but if you keep exposing them to this uncritically.... they will think about it that way.

answer: <p>yes. this.</p><p>i mean... a great example of what ur talking about is AAVE and appropriation. pretty much every kids show i’ve seen recently has a bunch of non-Black ppl using&nbsp;‘slang’ that is really AAVE as a way to mark their youth. it can’t be forgotten that this is written by adults.</p><p>but then it fall feeds into each other, yes? kids watch these shows and pick up some of the linguistic characteristics of the characters, who are then observed by adults who think that this is just how the youth speak these days, who then write it into their scripts, and on and on and on.</p><p>while the ppl (Black ppl) who actually are the source/origin/creators of many of the words and patterns of speech are actively oppressed for not speaking standard english.&nbsp;</p><p>its always weird to me that ppl don’t seem to realize that various oppressive attitudes are learned behaviours. and the shows we watched as kids are part of how we were socialized to think and behave in certain ways.</p><p>(and i haven’t even commented, yet, on all the misogyny in the show but i kind of figure that this is low hanging fruit and much easier to spot.)</p>
