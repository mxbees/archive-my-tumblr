question: Where do mestiz@ latin@s fit into a 5 race theory? A great deal of us are not white or white passing

answer: <p>in the classic five race theory there are:</p>
<ol>
<li>whites</li>
<li>Asians</li>
<li>Indigenous ppl</li>
<li>Malays</li>
<li>Black ppl</li>
</ol>
<p>so... mestis@s like _me_ since 'mestisa' isn't a latin@ only identity, fit into it in this way...</p>
<p>(like u can look up <a href="https://gs1.wac.edgecastcdn.net/8019B6/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb8b0g6IA71rgr3huo1_500.jpg">actual racial hierarchies</a>... of the spanish empire, you know)</p>
<p>mestis@s = red (or brown) mixed with white, or indios mixed with white (where within the spanish empire 'indio' could either mean Brown or Red, depending where it is... since in the Philippines, we were considered Brown, not Red (or yellow), which was geographically restricted to the americas).&nbsp;</p>
<p>and mestis@s were between full indios and whites in terms of privilege. and ALWAYS above Black ppl.</p>
<p>for the total spanish empire, Red/White mestis@s where higher than Brown/White mestis@s.</p>
<p>like we don't have to wonder about this sort of stuff. white ppl have been more than happy to classify and structure the world around these hierarchies.</p>
