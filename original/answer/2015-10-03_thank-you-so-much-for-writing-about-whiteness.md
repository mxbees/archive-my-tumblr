question: thank you so much for writing about whiteness. It's something I've wanted to read into. Along with Arnesen & Guglielmo who else would be worth checking out? I'm guessing not Steven Garner, the one you quoted?

answer: <p>based on my reading so far, those two are really the only ones who seem to have a view of whiteness that is similar to mine.</p><p>maybe the only other thing i’ve read that is good is Nell Irvine Painter’s _the history of white people_, i don’t always agree with her but she provides a really great historical overview of racism and white supremacy (and, by god, is one of the few who studied ‘whiteness’ that isn’t, it seems, a white man).</p><p>the garner book isn’t actually that bad, since it is the _only_ one i read on this that even _mentions_ the opposition to the dominant discourse. so in that sense it is maybe more ‘balanced’ than a bunch of other academics. i’ve only read chapters, though, so i can’t wholly endorse it.</p><p>
