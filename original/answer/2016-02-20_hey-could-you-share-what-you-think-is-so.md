question: hey could you share what you think is so ridiculous about the idea that capitalism makes mental illness worse or creates situations or structures that causes it? i'm v mentally ill (many hospitalizations and diagnoses) and to me the idea that it's not just "biology" or me individually but systemic shit (like capitalism) too started making lots of sense

answer: (in case anyone is wondering, this is a good example of how to ask a question that i’ll actually answer)

part of how to answer this depends on which model of disability you subscribe to, the medical model or the social model. the medical model is that disability (all disability) is biological/organic/whatever. the social model is that it is society that disables certain kinds of bodies and behaviours via normative ideas about which bodies are&nbsp;‘good’ and which are&nbsp;‘bad’.

i personally favour a mixed approach, such that some disabilities are biological/physical/whatever and that some are socially constructed (note: these, imo, can refer even to the same disabilities, it depends on the person and context i think).

now, the post i was originally making fun of literally posits the notion that capitalism *causes* either some or all mental illness. such that the&nbsp;‘cure’ for mental illness in their estimation is dismantling capitalism.

the reason this is absurd isn’t because capitalism has nothing to do with disability (especially in the social model), but because its too fucking simplistic. capitalism is simply *one* of many factors that create our social and cultural context. the removal of capitalism *alone* would literally do nothing to&nbsp;‘cure’ mental illness.

yes. capitalism absolutely contributes to how people are disabled and the way that we function within society. it impacts how we are perceived, it limits what we can do, it very often makes things so much worse than they need to be. i mean... any economic system that creates a value system where we are only considered worthwhile and valuable based on our productivity/ability to labour isn’t going to be very kind to certain kinds of bodies and minds. not to mention that capitalism totally can and does wear us into the ground.

but to say that dismantling capitalism alone would, what, either cure or just significantly improve disability is ahistorical and, tbh, naive. on that other thread, the person mentions an&nbsp;‘anti-cap utopia’ which is kind of.... pointless. if we live in a utopia *of any kind* it would be, by definition, either perfect or close to in how it deals with disability.

more to the point, we can, in fact, look back into history to see how pre-capitalist societies of various kinds across the globe, dealt with disability. all it takes is a cursory knowledge of the history of even one pre-capitalist economic system to realize that dismantling capitalism, on its own, is insufficient to achieve the desired result of also dismantling ableism. because ableism isn’t caused by capitalism, even if capitalism might be the cause of some disability.
