question: Oh! I actually didn't know that. I was always taught that since black people were brought here unwillingly via the slave trade we couldn't claim to be indigenous. Do you know where I could read up more on the subject?

answer: I'm not the best person to talk to about resources. Maybe followers will have suggestions. 

I'm happy to see that your previous ask was in good faith.
