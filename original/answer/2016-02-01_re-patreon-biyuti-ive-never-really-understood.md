question: Re: patreon & Biyuti. I've never really understood perks on patreon or if creators are required to offer them. If I'm going to support somebody on patreon it's generally because I want to better enable them to do the undercompensated work they're already doing, not because I want them to work on providing me extra content. If somebody does want/need to offer perks, I'd prefer something akin to brand building for them: a sticker or bookmark with their logo or some such.

answer: <p>huh. i guess this makes sense. i know with my personal patreon, i try to offer up *something* every month.&nbsp;</p><p>i’ve had a biyuti publishing page/account on patreon for a while but haven’t published it bc i just don’t know....&nbsp;</p><p>but the branding stuff is an interesting idea.</p><p>manatees for everyone? lol.</p>
