question: uh i'd say a way to see stereotypes about aces is to see which characters get headcanoned as ace the most ? (so mostly by people ace themselves but not only). i prefer to stay out of fandom stuff but i've seen  mainly white cis men who are 'intelligent' (whatever that means) and are kind of loners ? also maybe cold-hearted and with next to no romantical experience ?

answer: <p>hmmm.... &nbsp;yes. i guess this would make sense.</p><p>i don’t usually pay attention to that side of fandom either (unless it shows up in fic). and i do know that i’ve had some issues with how i’ve seen the occassional character written as ace.</p><p>(i literally think in every single case the character has been sex-repulsed. which fine, that’s a thing. but... some of us do enjoy sex.)</p>
