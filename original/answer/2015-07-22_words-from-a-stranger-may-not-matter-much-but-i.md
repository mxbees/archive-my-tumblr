question: words from a stranger may not matter much but i just want to say. thank you for sharing not just your knowledge, but who you are as a person. i'm not the best at providing descriptors for people but you're very real, and i enjoy following you and hearing about your life. it's a genuine pleasure to know you

answer: <p>oh!</p><p>i’m glad that my oversharing and lack of a general filtre is pleasing... :P</p><p>i mean.&nbsp;</p><p>it’s funny. for a little while i was like&nbsp;‘i’m going to keep my really personal stuff off my main tumblr/twitter account’ but... that sort of stopped. i love sharing the mundane details about my life bc, yes, i’m a real person.</p><p>and. by and large. my life is really fucking boring. lol.&nbsp;</p>
