question: i went to school in california and jocks were def a different social tier, they didnt go around actually pushing kids into lockers or anything and they were mostly friends/friendly with the teachers, but they were known to pick on certain vulnerable kids when no authority figures were looking. it wasnt like kids parted in the halls for them or stared as they walked past like in movies lmao, but there were cliques that had different social value/capital for sure.

answer: <p>*nods*</p><p>okay. i guess it would make sense that fiction would exaggerate some of this stuff.&nbsp;</p><p>thanks for letting me know.</p>
