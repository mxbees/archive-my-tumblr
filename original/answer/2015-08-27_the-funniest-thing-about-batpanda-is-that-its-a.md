question: The funniest thing about BATPANDA is that it's a joke.  The person who made the original post got it off that transmisogynistic website, Flight Rising.  The FR person who coined the term did it as a joke and the OP of the post took it way too seriously.  It's just massive laughs and failure all around

answer: <p>yeah. i saw the post from the person who coined it as a joke and it makes it all better.</p><p>especially since the earnest OP on tumblr who changed it to:</p><p>BATPANDANII</p><p>and i’m like... u made this so much more.</p><p>like&nbsp;‘indigenous genders’ as a single category? when there is trans/agender/neutrois/whatever?&nbsp;</p><p>just.... stop. STOP.</p>
