question: Would you accept advance copies of romance works to review?

answer: <p>um....</p><p>yes? but. i mean. i’m not sure why anyone would specifically want me to review their romance book. my reviews aren’t that great/helpful, i imagine, from a writer’s perspective.</p><p>also... i tend somewhat to listen to audiobooks rather than read, but i can probably do the thing.</p><p>just not sure why anyone would want me to.</p><p>i mean. do they really need to ask whether or not i like their closeted gay cop romance? bc i probably don’t. lol.</p>
