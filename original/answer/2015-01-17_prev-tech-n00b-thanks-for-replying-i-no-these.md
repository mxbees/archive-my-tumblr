question: (prev tech-n00b) thanks for replying =) i no these are old convos that i'm super late to. iguess now that i think abt it more, the part that feels weird is that that logic seems to imply that everyone has One True Static Gender, that sometimes theyre just wrong about, and against which "misogyny y/n?" has to be judged? which seems wrong (also do you then not experience misogyny?) but maybe also misogyny just feels like a more understood thing thn cisnormativity so ppl want to overapply? idk idk.

answer: <p>the... ontological stability of gender is kind of a different question.</p>
<p>but. the way i look at it is that if a person ever asserts&nbsp;</p>
<p>'i am a man'</p>
<p>then this means that, at least at that moment they are not a person who experiences misogyny. nor have they ever experienced it.</p>
<p>like. i'm not really interested (at this point) in exploring the edge cases.</p>
<p>i mean, yeah, since nonbinary ppl are a real thing. what can we say about a person who is bigendered and one gender is man and the other woman? likewise with gender fluid ppl...</p>
<p>but when i say 'men do not experience misogyny' i'm not talking about those ppl and few ppl actually are when this conversation comes up.</p>
<p>no. we are talking about ppl's whose gender is man. that's it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is about static gender but about identity.</p>
<p>and, yeah, there are logical systems where the law of identify fails (like mahayana buddhism) where part of the whole soteriological point is to understand that all identity is 0 (thus, you aren't you). and this assertion is often proved via demonstrating that identity isn't a stable ontological thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>but white ppl, esp. do not get to locate their identities within such a discursive space. bc they pushed their genders and the ontological system that structures it and forms the logic.</p>
<p>like. i'm not botherred by this when white ppl are happy to push a 'born this way' ideology of gender.</p>
<p>this is their system. and they have to live with the consequences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>consequences like gender being a stable ontological property of bodies.</p>
