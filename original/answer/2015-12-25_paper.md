question: paper

answer: <p>my favourite novel....</p><p>well. i *suppose* i should go with the novel that i have an entire paragraph tattooed on me, no? this would _bridge of birds_ by barry hughart. i read the book whenever iâ€™m feeling melancholic and it never fails to make me feel better.&nbsp;</p><p>(yes, the novel is problematic bc orientalism but... i love it anyway.)</p>
