question: I follow darkmatterrage on tumblr and twitter (gonna unfollow now tho) but i was wondering if you could elaborate on their antiblackness?

answer: <p>not really?</p>
<p>i didn't make the original callout and i'm not comfortable trying to repeat/recall the words of Black people from my not-always-reliable memory.</p>
<p>as i noted in the post, no Black person needs a specific reason to call any of us non-Black people out on anti-Blackness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>the word of Bad-Dominicana is enough for me (even if i didn't have some understanding for the context of her tweet).&nbsp;</p>
<p>you could try asking her.&nbsp;</p>
