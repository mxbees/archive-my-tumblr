question: what if trans people label ourselves skoliosexual though? but I agree tbh its use as a word is too appropriate-able to be helpful

answer: <p>i guess we could use it for ourselves....</p><p>it still seems a weird thing to me</p><p>like. calling an asian who only dates asians a&nbsp;‘rice queen’. to a certain extent there’s a default assumption that most people are willing to date within their own social class. its when they/we don’t that its labelled as odd.</p><p>idk.</p>
