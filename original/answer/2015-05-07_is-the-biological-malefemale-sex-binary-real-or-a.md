question: is the biological male/female sex binary real or a western colonial invention? I saw some posts on the medical side of tumblr shaming people who question the parameters that we place for sex.

answer: <p>[a partial answer is here](<a href="http://biyuti.com/8b">http://biyuti.com/8b</a>) which gives more details about how&nbsp;‘sex’ is determined and how slippery of a concept it is....</p><p>but. yes. it is a white colonial invention.&nbsp;</p><p>the medical side of tumblr can go fuck itself, for all i care.&nbsp;</p><p>them thinking that they have a right to gatekeep and police ppl’s bodies is why accessing healthcare as a trans person is dehumanizing and so fucking difficult.&nbsp;</p>
