question: While seeing images can be really nice, one thing I hate that this is reminding me of is how I literally cannot will myself to not see scary ass shit, unless i repeated open my eyes every time, or force myself to watch something else. And, even with my eyes open, I can still see the horror. @.@

answer: <p>yeah! good point.</p><p>this is one thing i’m *super* grateful for. there’s a lot of horrible shit i’ve seen that i can’t re-see from memory and i’m so happy about that.</p>
