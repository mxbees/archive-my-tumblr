question: Is it possible to make a patreon just for funding the labor and other costs that go into biyuti publishing? So there might be consistent funds for a rotating team of twoc editors/grant writers/etc? (I know it's wildly optimistic a patreon would raise enough, but maybe maybe maybe.)

answer: <p>i’ve thought about the patreon thing.</p><p>the main problem i see with that (which is kind of tied to the subscriptions on the site), is that other than the web-books, I can’t really offer much in the way of incentives. since each author has full control over their individual work, i can’t, say, give away free e-copies without their permission. which they may or may not give. in terms of the standard biyuti publishing contract all i’m allowed to do is to provide access to the web-book.</p><p>right now, the subscriptions on the site cover the server costs, which is good.&nbsp;</p><p>i also thought about fundraising on a per-book basis to cover labour costs for that one book....&nbsp;</p><p>but. idk. fundraising is hard work on its own. and then there is the whole incentive/perk problem again. :(</p><p>(also, if on per-book basis, what happens if a book doesn’t raise enough? we don’t publish and return everyone’s money?&nbsp;</p><p>also... re: patreon, one of the goals in my personal patreon is literally that if i can get enough money, i’ll quit my day job and focus on biyuti publishing. but i suppose make a clear distinction might actually help ppl.</p><p>i’ll keep thinking it over...</p>
