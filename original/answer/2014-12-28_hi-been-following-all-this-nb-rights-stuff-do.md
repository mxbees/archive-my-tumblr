question: Hi. Been following all this nb rights stuff. Do you think there's a dissonance between being poc and identifying as nonbinary, since being nonbinary (correct me if im wrong) relies on reifying and validating a settler state? To phrase another way, I'm asking if it's all nonbinary ppl by definition of IDing as nonbinary or only white nonbinary specifically that results in the aforementioned validation.

answer: <p>it is only white ppl identifying as nonbinary that reinforces the colonial logic of the binary.</p>
<p>the better way to understand iaopoc genders in relation to the binary is that&#8230; it is not really (or truly) accurate to call _any_ iaopoc gender &#8216;binary&#8217; or &#8216;nonbinary&#8217;. In other words, all iaopoc genders are neither binary nor nonbinary. </p>
<p>the thing to remember is that the binary (at least so far as we know it today) is a colonially imposed construction on indigenous gender systems.</p>
<p>this isn&#8217;t to say that there are no indigenous gender systems that are not organized around a binary. but rather that the binary that may structure a given indigenous gender system is relative to that system and, thus, ought not to be understood to have the same meanings and relationships that the white binary does.</p>
<p>an example:</p>
<p>we might call the Chinese gender system binary, since it mainly is. and we also know that the binary was organized in a patriarchial fashion (wherein men were more valued than women). </p>
<p>on the surface, this looks just like the binary and patriarchy of white colonialism&#8230; </p>
<p>but scratch that surface? and if you actually have knowledge about Chinese cosmology and the role that yin and yang play within it? </p>
<p>(note: yin = woman and yang = man)</p>
<p>you quickly realize that the Chinese gender binary =/= the white gender binary. </p>
<p>so. like. it obviously is coherent for Chinese ppl to say &#8216;hey, i&#8217;m nonbinary&#8217; without reifying the white supremacist binary, since we should understand this as referring to their _own_ gender system, rather than the white one. </p>
<p>another way to understand this is that there are many iaopoc who are, for whatever reason, forced to articulate our identities using a colonially imposed language (like me right now in english) and/or within a white dominant state. </p>
<p>the act of articulating our identities (binary or non) within this coercive and forced framework cannot be understood as supporting the framework, since that is part of our oppression (this position essentially blames us as victims and asserts that by identifying as non-binary we are oppressing ourselves, which is false). it also imposes an undue and unfair burden on those iaopoc who find comfort and use with white derived terms (like, a trans woman of colour calling herself a trans woman isn&#8217;t reifying the system that oppresses her). </p>
<p>the difference lies in the history of this act of identification. the white binary was created as a response to the agency of iaopoc. identifying ourselves is to use this very agency that white supremacy tells us we are not allowed to have. this holds true for _both_ binary and nonbinary trans iaopoc. since _neither_ are supposed to exist according to the white binary. likewise, this is also why trans iaopoc, in general, deal with the worst of what cissexism and cisnormativity have to offer, with the compounding effect of trans/misogyny experienced by dmab iaopoc (with variations, as well, resulting from race).</p>
<p>idk. i hope this makes some sense my brain just decided it had enough.</p>
