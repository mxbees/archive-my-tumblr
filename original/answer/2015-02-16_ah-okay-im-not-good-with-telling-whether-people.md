question: Ah okay. I'm not good with telling whether people are joking or not, and I know lots of people use comic sans as a joke so I thought I might as well ask. I didn't know all of those fonts were good for people with dyslexia, so I've learnt something new. I personally like typefaces that have full circles in them, they're more comforting in some way.

answer: <p>*nods* totally understandable re: the joking and the typefaces preference.&nbsp;</p><p>i'm using linux and i don't actually have century gothic as a font available on my system, so comic sans it is/was!</p><p>(i checked after you reminded me of the other fonts)</p><p>i mean... i could use something like arial or whatever, but i'm actually enjoying the unironic/sincere use of an accessible font that is much maligned for serious stuff.</p><p>i mean. in a very meta way, it provides this moment of hesitation</p><p>"is b. joking or being serious with this font and these messages?"</p><p>when, if you looking beyond the typography and stylistic elements, there is no reason at all to think that i'm just poking fun at things, given the topics in my gifs. sure. some are.... a little tongue-in-cheek, but they aren't jokes.&nbsp;</p>
