question: hey i noticed you reblogged that canada tweet thing from someone who uses "womyn" in their url. am I wrong in thinking that usage of that word is historically linked to transmisogyny and r fems?? i've been seeing it around in other places too and it keeps confusing me. has the meaning changed? is it being reclaimed?

answer: <p>well... i know the person with the url and they are using it ironically.&nbsp;</p><p>but yes. otherwise you are quite right.&nbsp;</p><p>as a general rule: womyn is a great way to identify radfems. i know a few others who use it who aren't radfems but...&nbsp;</p><p>yeah.</p><p>as a reminder to ppl who follow me: never refer to me as a 'womyn'. like. ever.</p>
