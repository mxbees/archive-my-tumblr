question: Before you start erasing the experiences of indigenous people, maybe start taking to task some of your mutual followers who are Latin and have no black, Asian, or indigenous ancestry (just Spanish or other European, so all of their ancestors are straight up colonizers) and still insist on calling themselves PoC. that's some bullshit. Labrujamorgan, for example.
