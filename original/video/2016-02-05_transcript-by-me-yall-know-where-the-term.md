Transcript (by me): 

Y'all know where the term 'woman of colour' came from? Who can say that? See we are bad at transmitting history.

In 1977, a group of Black women from Washington DC went to the National Women's Conference that Jimmy Carter gave 5 million dollars to have as part of the world decade for women. It was a conference in Houston, Texas.

This group of Black women carried to the conference something called the 'Black Women's Agenda' because the organizers of the conference, Bella Abzug, Ellie Smeal, and what have you, put together a three page women's minority plank, in a two hundred page document. That these Black women thought was somewhat inadequate.

And so they actually formed a group called the Black Women's Agenda to come there, in Houston, with a Black woman's plan of action, that they wanted the delegates to vote to substitute for the minority plank that was in the proposed plan of action. 

Well, a funny thing happened in Houston when they took the Black Woman's Agenda to Houston, then all the rest of the minority 'women of colour' wanted to be included in the Black Women's Agenda. Okay? Well they agreed, except that you could no longer call it the "Black Women's Agenda". And it was in those negotiations in Houston the term 'women of colour' was created. 

Okay? And they didn't see it as a biological designation. You're born Asian, you're born Black, you're African-Amer, whatever. It is a solidarity definition. A commitment to work in collaboration with other oppressed women of colour who have been minoritized. 

Now what's happened in the thirty years since then is that people see it as biology now. You know, like, okay. And people saying I don't want to be defined as a women of colour, I am Black, I am Asian-American. Well that's fine, but why are you reducing a political designation to a biological destiny. That's what white supremacy wants you to do. 

You know and, and I think its a setback. When we disintegrate as people of colour. You know? Around primitive ethnic claiming. You know? Yes we are Asian-American, Native-American, whatever, but the point is you choose to work with other people who are minoritized by oppression you have lifted yourself out that basic identity, into another political being. Another political space.

And, unfortunately, so many times people of colour hear the term 'people of colour' from other white people, that they think that white people created it. Instead of understanding that we, we self-named ourselves. This is a term that has a lot of power for us. But we've done a poor ass job of communicating that history so that people understand that power.
