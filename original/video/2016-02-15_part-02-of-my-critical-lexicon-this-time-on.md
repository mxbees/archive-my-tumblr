Hi. b. binaohan again. the word of the day is:

Trans/gender

My feelings about this were largely covered in the first edition, but its worth reprising them here (since this is a replacement of the first).

As always, I point to Denis Norris' post on TransGriot:

> In the early 1990s, 'transgender' was repurposed by a various groups of transsexuals in the US to basically include anyone whose gender expression was non-conforming with society's expectations. There were several reasons for this and one of them was because people with atypical gender identities do not always identify as transsexual.[^norris01]

Perhaps the most historically signficant detail of this lies in this later sentence: "We understood that to be transgender is to have a non-conforming gender expression regardless of one's gender identity"[^norris01]. Its important because it means that transgender was created explicitly as an umbrella that would cover any and all gender variation, this is inclusive of femme cis gays, butch lesbians, drag queens, etc.

It's a pretty broad category that, importantly, doesn't actually depend on gender identity. Thus, one could say that the distinction between 'transsexual' and 'transgender' is that one really is about your body/identity and the other is about the window dressing, the clothing you wear and how you express yourself (or even how others might perceive you). 

Of course, at this moment in time, twenty-five years later pretty much no one actually considers femme cis gays or butch lesbians to be 'trans/gender' in any meaningful way. Generally, neither respective community (and its members) tend to frame themselves that way, nor are they generally included in much of contemporary trans/gender activism and organizing.

Equally important, if you continue to read on, another key function of 'trans/gender' is to signal politics. Norris discusses how trans/gender was intentionally chosen as a way to create a cohesive movement that wasn't necessarily about assimilation to cisnormative society (in the way that True Transsexuals(tm) desired then and continue to push for today). The political intent and nature of this label is further developed in the second part of her post in the series:

> In fact, Transgender was originally intended to be the label used to describe the sociopolitical alignment of interests between multiple groups who face discrimination, harassment & violence due to having non-conforming gender expressions.[^norris02]

Interestingly, like many other similar umbrella terms (poc, queer, etc), it turns out that the original intent is actually much better than how the term shifted and moved through history. Much like 'poc' and 'queer', 'trans/gender' has shifted from being a label of political intent and alignment to one of identity. 

Thus, we must now deal with the endless territory fights over who 'is' and who 'isn't' trans. We must also deal with gatekeeping and the violence of identity policing. We've come up with various ways to test and determine who is Trans Enough to be admitted to the club.

And so it goes...

At this moment in time and for these specific purposes, its hard to really... parse how PORT and tpoc might want to engage and orient ourselves towards this term. I think the original intent and usage of the term is actually... somewhat closer to representing what a 'decolonized' trans label might look like.

Especially since it doesn't make a strong distinction between sexuality and gender, something which continues to be an active and vital part of poc communities today. For us? The schism that occured between white cis gays and cis lesbians and white trans ppl simply... isn't something that has managed to reach the same level within our communities. In many ways, how we exist and build communities entirely resists this. And I am speaking in a global context. Both within and without the US (the origin of the schism) you can find numerous examples of poc communities in which this schism appears to be a distant worry.

Unfortunately, much like the Gay Rights Movement(tm), trans/gender has become tied to white nationalism in the form of trans\*nationalism. Such that even if we recognize this early history of trans/gender, its current usage has been poisoned by white supremacy. 

Even the original political intent has been infected by this. Recall earlier where I pointed out that 'transgender' was used to contrast with the assimilationist goal of 'transsexual'. But, today, 'transgender' is no less assimilationist than 'transsexual' even if their visiosn of assimilation aren't the exact same.

And so 'transgender' despite a somewhat promising origin has become subsumed by the liberalism of white identity politics and now serves the interest of the State, rather than acting as a sight of resistance.
