i remember what i was going to write. an old friend that i don't speak frequently with anymore emailed me and i updated her on my life.

one thing i mentioned is that, for my student loans, i'm now 'permanently' disabled. 

i put it in quotes too, mainly bc that's the technical term that the government uses for it. i think its a bit silly but whatever.

but she was like 'i'm glad u put it in quotes because that isn't a good label to claim'

and i was reminded as to why we don't talk that much.

i responded with an explanation about why coming to understand and identify as disabled has actually been a really good thing for me. like... understanding that i have limits below the average person has helped me be more assertive about my boundaries and, overall, take better care of myself (bc i'm no longer harming myself by trying to push myself past my limits on a daily basis). 

but... i've changed so much since i moved out of vancouver. like. yeah. 

also i don't think she quite gets that i've *always been disabled*. the only difference is that now i know it. and i have some specific diagnoses to help me understand my limitations. 

doesn't matter whether or not i claim the label. the reality is that i am disabled.
