so. i've been playing around with this whole mug cake thing. and yeah, i love it bc it gives me a single sized portion instead of me, um, making an entire batch of cookies and eating them all.

bc texture is kind of a thing with me, here is the recipe for the cake with the most pleasent texture (it tastes good too, btw) according to me:

**Ingredients**

- 4tbs flour
- 2tbs brown sugar
- 2tbs peanut butter
- 5tbs water
- (optional) 1/4tsp baking powder
- (optional) a sprinkle of chocolate chips
 
**Directions**

1. Dump all ingredients into mug (order doesn't matter, I usually put in the dry ingredients then the wet so I don't have to dry the measuring spoon between).
2. Mix with great vigour! At least until most of the lumps and such are all gone. Overall, the batter will be thickish.
3. Microwave for a minute (depending on ur microwave).
4. Let cool for sufficient time so u don't burn ur mouth.
5. Eat!
