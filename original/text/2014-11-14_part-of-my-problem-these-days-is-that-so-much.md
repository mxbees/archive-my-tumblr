<p>part of my problem (these days)</p>

<p>is that so much of the trans discourse i see just bores the heck out of me</p>

<p>so too with a lot of queer stuff i see</p>

<p>half the time when i see something i find troubling</p>

<p>i just roll my eyes and scroll past it</p>

<p>bc i fucking <em>hate</em> repeating myself</p>

<p>but so often it is stuff i&#8217;ve already talked about&#8230;</p>

<p>just with the shit shuffled off to a different pile</p>
