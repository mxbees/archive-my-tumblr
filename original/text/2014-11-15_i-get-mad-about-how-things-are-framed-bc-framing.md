<p>i get mad about how things are framed bc</p>

<p>framing is so critically important for how we interpret a message</p>

<p>like, no, the framing doesn&#8217;t determine the meaning of the message</p>

<p>but the framing is what will import unstated and assumed assumptions</p>

<p>these assumptions are what makes the message coherent</p>

<p>so, for that hormone blocker post, the unstated assumption that medical interventions are the most critical and important kind for trans kids</p>

<p>is deeply harmful</p>

<p>(because of the pathologizing of transness and white medical models of gender and imperialism)</p>

<p>like&#8230; have u seen that stats for the number of trans women who self-harm or commit suicide after they get the Big Surgery?</p>

<p>yes, a lot of conservatives and whatever take this as evidence that GCS (and related technologies) are really mutilation</p>

<p>but the actual interpretation is that</p>

<p>medical interventions (as necessary as they sometimes are)</p>

<p>are insufficient on their own to dramatically improve the quality of life of trans women</p>

<p>so it matters a great deal</p>

<p>that when u are trying to give positive information like</p>

<p>'hormone blockers are safe for kids'</p>

<p>that you also note that</p>

<p>hormone blockers are <em>not</em> what will make a kid a boy or a girl or anything else.</p>

<p>nor are they a magical solution that will make all of your kid&#8217;s struggles with their gender magically evaporate.</p>

<p>parents of trans kids need to be prepared for more than just trying to provide appropriate health care. it is also about the emotional (and social) support.</p>

<p>and, yes, i fully expect that this information is conveyed in any and all info posts. because it matters.</p>
