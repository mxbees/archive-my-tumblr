i was just talking with a friend on the phone about madama butterfly....

and discussing how/why this is considered romantic. like. the story is obviously a tragic opera, since it isn't a comedy (and operas tend to be either tragic or comic).

my conclusion:

madama butterfly is the most performed opera and considered romantic because for white men, it actually *is* the perfect romance.

what white men want: for a Japanese women (and/or pretty much any woman of colour) to be so devoted to them that, when the white man disposes of them, they can't live without him, and so kill themselves.

they literally want our lives to have no meaning without them.
