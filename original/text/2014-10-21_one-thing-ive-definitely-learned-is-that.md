<p>one thing i&#8217;ve definitely learned&#8230;.</p>

<p>is that there is always that certain class of ppl</p>

<p>willing to bust out their disabilities</p>

<p>as an excuse for shitty behaviour.</p>

<p>except, that, um, you know that no one ever actually needs this?</p>

<p>y r apologies so hard????</p>

<ol><li>i&#8217;m sorry 2. this is how i fucked up 3. i&#8217;ll try not to do it again</li>
</ol><p>three steps.</p>

<p>no one needs to know that maybe ur meds are messed up. or that u have autism.</p>

<p>u only look extra fucking silly</p>

<p>when literally <em>everyone else</em> in the conversation</p>

<p>has a disability of some kind too.</p>

<p>and (by magic i&#8217;m sure)</p>

<p>none of us are fucking up.</p>
