title: advocate makes clueless reference to civil rights movement
---
when i saw the original comment from Lila Perry, i sort of... shrugged bc she's young[^1]. not that this is an excuse for the anti-Blackness, just a reason for her ignorance. at issue is comments like this:

>Surrounded by almost 40 supporters gathered Monday to counter the transphobic rally, Perry drew parallels to well-known anti-segregationist, Jim Crow-era battles in the American civil rights movement. 
>"It wasn't too long ago that white people were saying that they don't feel comfortable sharing a bathroom with a black person, and history repeats itself," 

many Black ppl have discussed why comparisons like this are harmful and anti-Black, and i'm not going to talk about that (bc they say it better than me). 

but rather... as a non-american, for a long time i really didn't get why 'civil rights' was a such a... term of contention amongst Black americans. of course, this is bc i didnt' learn american history to any real extent. i didn't understand that while in canada 'civil rights' can be a broadly used term to describe a kind of political agenda, in the american context it really refers to a specific history and context. 

i encourage everyone to learn about this context and why comparisons like this are anti-Black.
