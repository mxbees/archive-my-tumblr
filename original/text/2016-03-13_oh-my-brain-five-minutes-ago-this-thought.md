oh my brain.

five minutes ago this thought appears: 'ok. but have you maybe considered actually doing hormones? like really considered it? if not, maybe you should.'

me: 'wat. at no point have i actually wanted to do this. why would u do this to me? why now?'

brain: you gotta

me: 'but i'm supposed to get tits in a few months. how the fuck...'

brain: \*i will now google whether or not you can do hrt after breast augmentation\*

half an hour later: why. why am i doing this?

brain: \*cackles\*
