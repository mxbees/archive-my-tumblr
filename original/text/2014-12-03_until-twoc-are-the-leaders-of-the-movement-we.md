<p>until twoc are the leaders of the movement we started</p>

<p>every other group trying to squeeze themselves into what we started</p>

<p>(while maintaining a system where we are pushed out and exploited)</p>

<p>you assholes can</p>

<p><em>wait</em></p>

<p>or maybe wake the fuck up to the fact that</p>

<p>uplifting and support twoc</p>

<p>would do so much more to improve your lives</p>

<p>than trying to join a shitty umbrella whose existence depends on</p>

<p>exploitation and hegemony</p>
