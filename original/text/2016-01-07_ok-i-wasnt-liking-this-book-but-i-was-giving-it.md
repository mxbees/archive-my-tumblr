ok. i wasn't liking this book. but i was giving it a chance. 

but. with what just happened.... I can't. 

one of the characters threatens his brother who is apparently physically violent with his wife with exposure. and we're supposed to cheer him on bc the brother is homophobic. 

all I can think about is how the wife,  ultimately is the one who'll pay the price for this.
