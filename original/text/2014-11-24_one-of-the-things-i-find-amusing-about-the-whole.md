<p>one of the things i find amusing about the whole</p>

<p>'doctors need to know about ur ~biological~ sex'</p>

<p>is that my health card has an F on it now</p>

<p>i&#8217;m not on hormones. and i&#8217;m not doing surgery.</p>

<p>how do these ppl</p>

<p>(who obvs live somewhere you need surgery to get the change of gender marker, but um&#8230; like this isn&#8217;t true in every context anymore)</p>

<p>actually think that this works?</p>

<p>like.</p>

<p>ur wrong. end of stroy. laws and stuff are changing to accommodate the reality that ~biological~ sex is irrelevant</p>

<p>argentina allows anyone to change their birth certificate on their own word.</p>

<p>i (partially) live in a jurisdiction where i can change gender markers without surgery.</p>

<p>as far as my health system is concerned</p>

<p>i&#8217;m female.</p>

<p>end of story.</p>

<p>and all u assholes who&#8217;re like</p>

<p>'doctors need to know'</p>

<p>can go fuck urself bc, well, this is actually factually incorrect.</p>

<p>or rather, my doctors (and any future medical practitioner i deal with in my country)</p>

<p>know my gender/sex.</p>

<p>and it is the one i say it is.</p>

<p>so. what.</p>
