its taken a few years.

but i really and truly understand what some ppl have been talking about.

that feeling of seeing ur words/concepts/frameworks spoken by other mouths

words that u sometimes got harassed over.

concepts you struggled with.

frameworks you barely understand but tried to communicate

but. almost nowhere. and no one who does this.

actually and really even maybe remembers who you are.

(and that's the most charitable interpretation)

i don't want to own ideas

but i do want my labour and contributions to be recognized.

and yet...
