u know what lets me know that there is a problem with inaccessibility of theory?

it isn't assuming that someone with less education than me can't read and understand.

its the *fact* that i know ppl with as much education as me who can't read and understand.

like. one of my friends during her MA literally *cried* bc judith bulter is so fucking hard to understand.

sure. sure. she's a special case. 

but u know what *else* lets me know that there is a problem with theory in english? bc i can read other languages, u know.

u really think there aren't ppl who are capable of expressing complex ideas and concepts without all the fucking window dressing?

the problem is that these ppl always confuse complexity with difficulty. 

they aren't the same thing. 

and my god. even if ur going to do the academic wank thing. at least be realistic about who you consider your audience.

acamedic wank has its time and place. but that's the fucking point: take it out of its context and it *does* become inaccessible garbage.

and yeah. its unlikely any given writer will ever be talented enough to render their writing universally accessible. again. not. the. fucking. point.
