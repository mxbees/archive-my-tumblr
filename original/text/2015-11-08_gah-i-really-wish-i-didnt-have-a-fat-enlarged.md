gah. i really wish i didn't have a fat, enlarged liver.

i mean. i've actually been eating pretty good the past few days. and yet. i'm still feeling discomfort/pain bc of my fucking liver.

why.

i guess i don't really consider this 'chronic' despite the fact that i have flareups several times a week and while it isn't super painful.. idk. how to describe the feeling. but i hate it. and i'm sick of it.
