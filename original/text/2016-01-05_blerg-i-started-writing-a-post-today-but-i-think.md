blerg. i started writing a post today... but i think i need to spend more time processing.

its funny how many posts about being filipina and the PH i start writing, actually write, that just end up sitting in my drafts. i have...

a lot of different ideas and things to say.

i guess i haven't been entirely convinced that it is either my place to say it or that it is me who ought to be saying it.

based on something i read recently the answer very well might be:

'its nice and all that you have feels, but stfu'
