this is mostly for fun. not sure if this is something i'll keep up with. 

today's book is [_love means... no shame_](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6909649-love-means-no-shame) by andrew grey.

the plot of this book is, in a sentence, a story of a cowboy and amish man falling in love.

the main conflict of the story is that the amish man is on a year away trying to decide if he wants to be baptised or not. so the MC falls in love with him and spends a large portion of the book worrying that he'll leave at the end of the year.

its the source of a lot of angst.

this wouldn't be puzzling, if not for the 9 million times the MC says, "i'm worried that he's going to leave, but i can't tell him that" or something to that effect. like here is a reconstructed scene:

> Jeff went quiet thinking that Eli might choose to go back to his family at the end of the year.

> "is everything ok?" eli asks.

> jeff knows he shouldn't tell eli about his worries, because he needs to make his own decisions, so he smiles and says, 'yes'

variations of this scene happen like five fucking times. and each time all i can think of is "why. why can't u tell him that you want him to stay."

i. don't. get. it.

i get that miscommunication is like... a primary plot device for most romance/fic writers. i even get why, since it is an easy way to build tension.

what i don't get is the reasoning always provided for it.

towards the end, the MC is like "i would never make eli choose between me and his family and this is why i can't tell him that i want him to stay."

what the fuck do these two things have to do with each other??????

is this how normal ppl actually think?
