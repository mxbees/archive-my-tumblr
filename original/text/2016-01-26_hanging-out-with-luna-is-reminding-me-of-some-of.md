hanging out with luna is reminding me of some of the real benefits of seeing ppl offline (or privately).

i don&#39;t think most ppl on here realize that most of my social interactions with my friends happen where everyone can see. and so... i&#39;m always pretty careful about what i say and what i reveal.

i just got to share with <a class="tumblelog" href="http://tmblr.co/mzJ4hv6DdKGWDCR1O_Syc1g">@lunamerbruja</a> a bunch of the various ideas that've been sitting in my head for a while now but that i don't have the energy to blog about bc i don't feel like dealing with the (pretty much inevitable) fallout.

like. one of the things i keep writing about and then stuffing in my drafts to collect dust is about being 'indian' without being indigenous....

which relates to the ideas i have about 'indigenous' as a modern, pan-racial idea and how this interacts with racism (and the consequences thereof)

but also about the differences in how certain discourses are policed and their relative openness to ppl in the out group engaging in them and reasons why this might be the case

i want to talk about land, indigeniety, culture, and being ground zero for spanish colonization

i want to talk about community identity policing and how so much of it is actually based on inter-personal conflict, rather than any actual desire to maintain the integrity of the community.

and so many other ideas about teh Meta-Discourse.....

but. i just don't feel like dealing with all the ppl who like what i say right up until i'm applying my skills for analysis and pattern recognition re: intellectual history to them or their community....
