re: discussion about improving my writing.

i think, based on feedback, what i really need to do is focus on getting back into the habit of editing.

i know why, though, i'm so resistant to the idea for my blogging.

nowadays, i write bc i enjoy it. bc i feel called to do so.

once upon a time, when i was a baby bee, i was in university.

and i was a terrible writer. and very, very slow.

so i learned to edit. i also learned that if i wanted a decent grade on any paper i turned in, that i'd need to finish about a month before the deadline so that i could spend the rest of the time editing it until i would get a horrible mark.

i think each paper i turned in, right up until my MA (and for part of my MA too), i did about 10 drafts for each paper. 

writing papers (writing in general) was a long, slow, and tedious (and often frustrating) activity.

over the years, sure, i got better and more efficient.

but idk. it feels like editing sucks some of the joy out of writing for me.

in any case, this is where i'm going to focus for now and we'll see how that goes.
