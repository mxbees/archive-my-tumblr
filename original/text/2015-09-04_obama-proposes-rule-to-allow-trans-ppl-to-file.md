title: Obama proposes rule to allow trans ppl to file civil rights violations against
  medical ppl who deny care
---
> Today, after pressure from LGBT advocacy groups, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services proposed a new policy that will enable transgender Americans to file claims of civil rights violations against physicians, insurers, and hospitals that fail to provide trans-affirmative healthcare care.

> The policy clarifies the scope of the Affordable Care Actâ€™s nondiscrimination clause, Section 1557. The proposed policy forbids insurers from denying transgender patients transition-related health care like hormone therapy, counseling, and surgical procedures that that have previously been considered aesthetic.
