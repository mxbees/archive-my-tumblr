do u know how many questions i have about being pilipinx

that are about a million times more interesting than rehashing


the same argument about what race we are?

(which... unlike a lot of places/ppl, our race -- never white -- has actually changed over time. that's what really gets me about this debate. we are amongst the few people whose race hasn't remained stable for the entirety of white supremacy. and yet so many of us want to act like we can actually, factually determine it. our own history resists an easy, simple categorization. what race are we? when are you talking about? our race now isn't the same as it was 100 years ago. so... which literally means my great-grand lolo was technically a different race than i am today. now *this* is interesting. not so much trying to definitively fix what has always been a contested reality for us.)
