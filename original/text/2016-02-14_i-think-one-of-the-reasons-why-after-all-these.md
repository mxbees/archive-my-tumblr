i think one of the reasons why, after all these years, i still consume as much fiction as i do

(esp. the ~trashy~ genres or fic)

is bc i constantly find the way ppl behave in these books baffling and surprising.

like. do ppl actually act like this? do they behave like this?

i often hear about 'identifying' with characters but.

this isn't really something i do. i can't imagine myself as pretty much any of these ppl.

i can't imagine myself having their life bc i just... could not. live. like. that.

can't imagine myself in about 99% of the situations characters find themselves.

its all so strange.
