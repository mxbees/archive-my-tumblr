title: when white trans ppl are white
---
I had the great pleasure of reading [this piece of trash with the lovely title of "Close Encounters of a Third Gender"][close]. Written by the kind of shitty white True Transsexual(tm) that absolutely loves to do this, I'm not entirely surprised by how this article played out. I mean... the title kind of says it all, no?

For those who don't know... the title of this article is a 'clever' play on words of [Stephen Spielberg's movie "Close Encouters of the Third Kind"][third]. Which is a scifi movie about aliens. Take a moment to appreciate the parallel she's invoking here. Third gendered ppl are equivalent to aliens from outerspace. Strange Weird and often Threatening. Its also an interesting equivocation because of what aliens often represent in white scifi[^scifi].

Anyway. I don't actually want to deconstruct her argument. Because its boring and I've seen it a thousand times.

What is interesting, though, is some of the cognitive dissonance over how she invokes the 'history' of third genders in a global context. Weirdly, she actually makes a decent point on this: "While advocates cheered this development as progressivism, multiple genders are as old as the ages". Which is more insightful than a lot of what I've seen from white enbies. This follows by a list of cultural examples of 'third genders'. She then points to a map that shows that this is a global, cultural thing. And even how (the map) "the west" has no clear analogues to this (even as she mentions the Indigenous ppl in "the west" lmao). 

But then there's the transition:

> For me -- a transsexual whose identity revolves at least in part around a gender binary -- whether the refraction of multiplicity in the gender spectrum is a good thing depends on the extent to which acceptance follows. Unfortunately, challenging the gender binary can create unease that the transgender movement only exacerbates -- with consequences to transgender people who do not necessarily identify as a third, or other, gender.

wat.

You literally just pointed out that the 'multiplicity in the gender spectrum' is simply a fact. Like. Reality. It isn't new (as many white enbies like to think). You yourself said this two paragraphs before. You literally assert a historical progression wherein the gender binary is a later, culturally specific invention. But then she reverses everything. Within the conceptual domain she just created, it is far more accurate for her to frame her analysis like this:

How does enforcing a gender binary, something the "transgender movement only exacerbates", create unease and consequences for those who do not identify within the binary?

She literally set up a domain wherein you cannot say that a "refraction of multiplicity in the gender spectrum" is something that can harm binary people, not when the reverse is true. Since the spectrum pre-dates the binary, it is the binary that challenges what is actually real and true. Thus, the enforcement of it is what creates harm.

You said this. You exploited the history of colonized ppl's in order to make this rhetorical point. And yet....

Anyway. She goes on to use an actual radfem to support her opinion, lmao. 

She then concludes with:

> Regardless of what anyone says, there is no escaping that some people -- if not many or even most -- would classify human beings as male or female based on anatomy. Differences in bodies are real. So are the impressions of others. Is it really our place to claim that how they see things is wrong?

OMG. YOU STARTED THIS ARTICLE POINTING OUT HOW THE MAJORITY OF THE WORLD DID NOT AND DOES NOT DO THIS.

She literally makes the claim that how she sees things is wrong. She says this.

Cognitive Dissomany level 10,000. Good job.

[^scifi]: One way to understand the function of aliens and why they often behave as they do in white scifi, is to note that often they are the embodiment of the white anxiety that they'll be subjected to the kind of genocidal colonialism they inflicted on the rest of the world. This pervasive fear that Beings Who Are Not Us will, obviously, only come to steal, occupy, invade, murder, etc... This is literally what white ppl did to the globe.
