you know. i never actually used to think that i had a problem with impulse control.

but i very clearly do. 

this whole 'shaving ur head' thing is literally coming out of nowhere.

and now i'm busily trying to rationalize all the reasons why it is a good idea and that i should do it tomorrow or some junk.

but the reality is, is that i got the idea in my head. and now i want to do it. i might be able to come up with some decent reasons for why i ought to. but at the end of it all? i really just want to do it to silence the urge i have in my head. this... driving need i have to just Do The Thing.

though, this is the first time that i'm really acknowledging this for what it is.

the problem? i don't really have any really effective strategies for disarming this impulse.

my desire for survival usually overrides any of the truly destructive impulses i have.....

but most things short of this? yeah. not so much.

i'm guessing i'll shave my head by the end of december.

(my bf is going away for xmas and me having like a week by myself with no surpervision? my hair is doomed. goodbye hair.)
