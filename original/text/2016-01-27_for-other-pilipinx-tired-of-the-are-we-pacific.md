for other pilipinx tired of the 'are we pacific islanders, asians, whatever' debate, i have a suggestion for 2016:

let's discuss whether we are brown or yellow.

let's roll back this discussion to 100 years ago.

i'm tired of the modern debate, especially when this more fundamental question has yet to be adequately answered.
