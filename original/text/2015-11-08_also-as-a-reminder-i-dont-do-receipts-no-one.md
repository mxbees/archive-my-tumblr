also: as a reminder, i don't do receipts.

no one has to believe anything i say. but i know what i've seen and won't allow anyone to gaslight me into thinking that i'm mistaken about things i've actually witnessed.

if my word isn't good enough for you?

\*shrugs\*

that isn't my problem. 

beyond this, no receipts are **ever** needed to 'prove' that any given non-Black person is anti-Black. its literally our default position. just as i don't do receipts to prove any given white person is racist. this is your default position.

the burden of proof is on you.

just as the burden to prove that i'm not anti-Black (or at least trying to do something about it) is on me.
