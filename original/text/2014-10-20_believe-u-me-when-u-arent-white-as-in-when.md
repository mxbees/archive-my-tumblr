<p>believe u me</p>

<p>when u aren&#8217;t white</p>

<p>(as in when most ppl u encounter code u as something other than white)</p>

<p>u know.</p>

<p>U KNOW</p>

<p>saying this as a light-skinned poc who frequently coded as white in the city i lived in before</p>

<p>when u aren&#8217;t white</p>

<p>ppl tell u every fucking day that u aren&#8217;t</p>

<p>sometimes by words but also by deed.</p>

<p>in how they look and treat u.</p>
