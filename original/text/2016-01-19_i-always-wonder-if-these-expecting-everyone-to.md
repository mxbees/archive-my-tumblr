i always wonder if these 'expecting everyone to live ethically is ableist' ppl

really REALLY understand the implications of what they are asserting

do you know who our society generally thinks isn't capable of ethical reasoning?

children. or animals.

one of the reasons why children have a different set of consequences for harmful actions is precisely bc we think that they are not quite capable of moral reasoning, such that they should be thought to be as accountable as an adult.

these ppl are literally saying that being disabled is similar to being a child. or an animal.

that, bc of disability, they can't be held to the same levels of accountability as abled people.

idk about you, but this strikes me as more ableist.

if disabled ppl aren't capable of 'adult, able moral reasoning' then we aren't (and shouldn't be allowed to be) entitled to the same rights and agency as abled ppl. 

which... interestingly is literally the argument that has been used to discredit and discount the agency of disabled ppl for a long, long time.

go figure.
