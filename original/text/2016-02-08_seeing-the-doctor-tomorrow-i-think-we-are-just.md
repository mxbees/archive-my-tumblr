seeing the doctor tomorrow. I think we are just doing a med check in to see if everything is going fine. 

I think it is. pretty sure I'm just going to keep things steady. things aren't perfect but this is honestly better than i've been in a while. I can tell that I'm still depressed though. 

I did do some blood work last week to check how my triglycerides are doing. and maybe my vitamin b and iron levels. 

also seeing the liver specialist thursday. I'm going to guess that my liver hasn't really improved. I guess i just hope that it isn't getting worse.
