title: some initial observations towards a general theory of abuse
---
I'm poking around and doing some research for the conversation I'm having with some friends about 'abuse' and how it is used.

First observations:

- Searching both google and a research library, its pretty clear that there isn't any real, easy to find resource that discusses 'abuse' as a general concept.
- For curious ppl, here is the search query I was using to try and find a *general* resource:
    `abuse AND (understanding OR introduction OR defining) -substance -sexual -child -elder -domestic`[^1]
- You know what I found? Despite running enough queries that google asked me to prove I wasn't a bot? Nothing.
- The point that is really highlighted is that if there are resources that discuss 'abuse' as a general concept, they aren't easy to find.
- As far as I can tell, the only generic definition of abuse comes from the dictionary:

    > treat (a person or an animal) with cruelty or violence, especially regularly or repeatedly.
- Maybe [wikipedia][1]:

    > Abuse is the improper usage or treatment of an entity, often to unfairly or improperly gain benefit. (but if you follow the citation, this is from the dictionary too).
- google `abuse` and these are the first two hits.

Second observations:

- Most (if not all) resources on abuse split themselves up in one of two ways: either by the group of victims (children, women, etc) or by the type of abuse (emotional, physical, etc.).
- We could attempt to inductively arrive at a 'general theory of abuse' by analyzing the various types/groups and looking for commonalities. (I'm surprised no one has actually done this, tbh)
- This might be worthwhile to do before getting any further into this (so that instead of speculating, we're working with the closest thing we can find to a general understanding of abuse.

Um... I think I might actually have to do this myself. Probably using wikipedia as my general resource, since lots of people use it as a starting point for research (myself included). It's also freely and widely available (and generally easy to find).

[^1]: This was mainly used in the research library site since google no longer recognizes parentheses in searching queries. I picked the three works 'understanding, introduction, and defining' as a way to hopefully net me some beginner level stuff. Like really general discussions. The series of `-[term]` are there to remove many of the results that are about a specific kid of abuse only.
