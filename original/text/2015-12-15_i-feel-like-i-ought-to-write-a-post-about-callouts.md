i feel like i ought to write a post about callouts and naming names

about how it is, unfortunately, more dangerous than a lot of ppl are willing to credit

its nice and all to say

'hey, u should stand up for self/others. resist teh oppression.'

until you do just that and ur entire life is fucking ruined.

ruined and at the end of it all?

you accomplished all of nothing.
