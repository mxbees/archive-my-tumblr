title: Thai trans people concerned about possible loophole
---
Thailand is about to pass a Gender Equality Act that contains a section which is concerning trans activists.

> The act gives the government a legal platform to protect the rights of LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex) citizens, according to activists

> However, some activists are concerned about Section 17, which is seen as a barrier to creating equality.

> Section 17 says any act by the public and private sector that concerns the freedom, security and protection of others, or in accordance with the rule of religion or national security would not be considered an act of discrimination towards the LGBTI.
