although, if ppl want to preemptively block/unfollow,

so you don't have to see the post, please feel free.

i don't pay attention to those numbers and who is or isn't following

as a hint

i fully expect to be accused of

homophobia, queerphobia, and/or lesbophobia

(or some combination thereof)

so if you think that twoc who date men

'take up too much space' or whatever

this is your fair warning to go ahead and block/unfollow me now.

bc i've reached my limit with something i started to observe a few years ago

combined with what i most wanted to talk about in 2015

and seeing basically every discussion derailed

i'm. done.
