I kind of feel bad for this person because they tried really really hard with this article. But the repeated use of 'transgenderism' and 'trangendered' made me cringe. Nonetheless, some good information here:

> The few studies done in Canada have found that half of the trans population in Canada live in poverty with an annual income below $15000, 1 in 5 transgender people in Canada is need or are at risk of needing homeless shelter assistance, and 74 percent school going Trans children face at least verbal harassment. This clearly indicates they are starkly worse off even when compared to the rest of the LGBTQ+ community.

> More tellingly, forty-three percent of the transgender population in Ontario has attempted suicide at some point, attributed to feelings of shame and isolation that arises from inescapable systemic discrimination.

> Transgender and Transsexual transitioning services are covered by the government of Ontario if the person receives treatment through select clinics. Until recently, The Center of Mental Health and Addiction (CAMH) was the only place for government insured transitioning services in Canada. After controversy over practice of conversion therapy at CAMH, reports of mistreatment of trans-persons, complaints of years long wait-times for appointments, and a few lawsuits about coverage and other issues, the Ontario government announced at the end of June 2015 it will be expanding this list of insured clinics.

> However, Marikoâ€™s supportive doctor advised them to hyperbolize their distress and match the stereotypical narrative, in order to get recognized as Transgender and approved for transitioning in Ontario. Medical professionals, Mariko says, are told to allow transitioning as a last resort of sorts, only brought to the table when there is no hope of their patient being cisgender.
