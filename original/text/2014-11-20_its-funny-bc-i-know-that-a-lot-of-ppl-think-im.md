<p>its funny. bc i know that a lot of ppl think i&#8217;m more &#8216;popular&#8217;</p>

<p>or something</p>

<p>than i really am. even at my old tumblr&#8230;. i probably had a fraction of the followers that ppl thought i did.</p>

<p>when i deleted that account, i think i had just gone over 1k?</p>

<p>this blog has less than 400. my twitter account has about the same.</p>

<p>it isn&#8217;t like i&#8217;ve made thousands and thousands of dollars from my book.</p>

<p>i&#8217;m poor.</p>

<p>i&#8217;m unknown.</p>

<p>i don&#8217;t get invited to give talks at places.</p>
