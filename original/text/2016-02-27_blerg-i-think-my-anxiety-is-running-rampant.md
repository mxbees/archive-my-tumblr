blerg. i think my anxiety is running rampant again. i've got the Restlessness.

its weird. its been quite a few months since its been this bad.

debating another ativan or using the Alternative Medicine....

but. since i'm kind of recovering from being sick Smoking seems like it'd be a Terrible Idea.

maybe i'll flip a coin.
