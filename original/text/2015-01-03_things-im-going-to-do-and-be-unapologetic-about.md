<p>things i&#8217;m going to do and be unapologetic about in 2015.</p>

<p>by and large. i&#8217;m only going to be boosting fundraisers by twoc. and maybe other qtpoc at my own discretion.</p>

<p>but especially twoc fundraisers. stuff for white trans ppl often gets thousands of notes while twoc get few and rarely meet funding goals.</p>

<p>i&#8217;m not sorry.</p>

<p>when the entire world cares as much about twoc as i do, then i&#8217;ll start caring about the rest of the world more.</p>
