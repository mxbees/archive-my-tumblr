title: NGO urges that Intersex be included in trans rights bill
---
>The non-inclusion of intersex persons in the Transgender Rights Bill, 2014, passed successfully in the Rajya Sabha recently is a cause for concern for gender rights activists.

>Worried over this category of people being kept out of the purview of the Bill, Srishti Madurai, a gender rights organisation, has decided to take up their cause.

>“We will impress upon BJP MP Shobha Karanlaje, who is likely to sponsor the Bill in the forthcoming Lok Sabha session, to include intersex persons too,” said Gopi Shankar, founder-member of Srishti.
