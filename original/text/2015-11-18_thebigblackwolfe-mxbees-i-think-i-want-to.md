<p>I think i want to write a ‘how to write a kissing scene without making me want to puke’ for ppl who write mm romance. </p>

<p>bc. your kissing scenes make me gag and laugh with disgust.</p>

<p>I’ve read so many yikes worthy kissing scenes over the years it’s not even funny. They’re even worse than the yikes worthy sex scenes imo, especially the ones where they don’t actually describe any of the kissing except in ~metaphor~</p>

<p>sometimes, i groan so loudly that i disrupt my bf sitting in the next room.<br/><br/>he can tell what i'm doing based on my exlamations of disgust. </p>
