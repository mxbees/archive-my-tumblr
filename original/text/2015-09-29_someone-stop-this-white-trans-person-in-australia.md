title: Someone stop this white trans person in australia
---
I actually got clued into this story via reading some random pro-life white woman's anti-trans garbage. And while I normally would've focused on that, she quotes this part of this story:

> The 43-year-old, who is biologically female but identifies as gender diverse, has grown used to it.

> "I identify with the concept of a walker, which is a Native American term for someone who walks between genders. At any point people will call me male, or sir, which is great when you're buying a car," she joked, "But I'm just as comfortable in a group of women."

Oh. I see.

Don't do this white people. Just don't.
