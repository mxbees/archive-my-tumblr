i think the thing that has finally driven it home that i am chronically ill 

is this shrodinger's cold i currently have.

since it is just starting (or maybe not) the symptoms are mild.

so literally can't tell if how i feel is my normal kind of garbage or if i actually am coming down with a cold.

but like. if my general default embodied experience is such that i can't tell if i caught my bro's cold or not. says a lot about how i feel on a daily basis.
