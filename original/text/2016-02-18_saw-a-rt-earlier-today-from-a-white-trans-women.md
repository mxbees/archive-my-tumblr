saw a RT earlier today from a white trans women generally considered a Leader(tm) in teh community.

said something about how silent allies are useless bc trans ppl can't make ourselves heard on our own....

first. who the fuck still uses 'allies' unironically in 2016?

second. it'd be preferrable if ~allies~ would just stop oppressing us, rather than doing whatever it is you think they should be doing.

third. you'd know what'd also be really nice? if white trans women like u would stop taking up so much fucking space and drowning out the ppl who really need to be heard.

fourth. stfu.

fifth. i'm so sick of all of u.
