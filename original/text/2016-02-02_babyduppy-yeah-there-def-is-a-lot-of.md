yeah. there def. is a lot of anti-Blackness in adventure time too. :S

um...

also. i think u might've blocked my follow back account bc i can't reblog ur posts to make a comment on them.

(my mistake though, bc i don't think i sent u a message to let u know that it was me who was following u, bc this isn't my primary blog. send me a message if u want to know.)
