title: How the police and mainstream media perpetrate violence against twoc victims
---
Keen observers will note that I've said pretty much the same thing as this article in the recent past. The way both the media and authorities treat twoc victims of violence only serves to compound that violence both to their memories and to their family and loved ones.

>Keyshia Blige of Illinois and Jasmine Collins and Tamara Dominguez of Missouri – the most recent trans murders to be reported – were killed months prior to reports of their deaths. Their killings weren’t even thought of as crimes against transgender people until last week, as initial police and local news reports identified the women by the wrong gender, even though the people around them and their physical presentation on the crime scenes clearly marked them as women.

>But wrongly identifying trans women doesn’t just skew statistics on trans murders or affect national awareness. It also affects the victims’ loved ones.

>It took approximately 24 hours for Dominguez’s partner, Cristian, to find out that his partner was brutally murdered, he told me after her funeral in Kansas City last week – and it took even longer for other family members to learn what happened. Friends of Collins’s assumed for over 10 days that she had left town or was laying low, and many didn’t find out about her June death until accurately reported in August.

To connect this reality with a different set of numbers to the global reality of trans women of colour being murdered, the org that monitors the global situation has noted that there are more trans women who are reported being killed in countries with a strong trans movement. What this means isn't that there are more murders, necessarily, in those countries but rather the local communities are able to ensure that these murders are accurately recorded and accounted for. 

These examples highlight this reality. Whatever you think the numbers are, they are higher since we have no way of knowing how many twoc have been murdered by the authorities called them 'man dressed in woman's clothing' and the news reported the same and their families were content to bury them as such. The reality is, is that we _don't actually know_ whether or not violence against twoc is increasing because we don't have an accurate baseline (the further we go into the past, the less likely it is that a victim's gender identity was respected and recognized). 

All we know is that overall changes in culture bc of twoc organizing has improved the reporting. That's it.
