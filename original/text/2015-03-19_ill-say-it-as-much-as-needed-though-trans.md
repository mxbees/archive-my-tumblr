I'll say it as much as needed though. 

Trans women, should we have penises, are not privileged because of them. Not ever. 

Not even a little bit. 

So be careful when trying to talk about "people with penises" as if cis men and trans women with penises EVER share some common privilege. 

Now _that_ is classic transmisogyny.
