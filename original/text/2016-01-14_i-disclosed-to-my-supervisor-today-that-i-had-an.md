I disclosed to my supervisor today that I had an autism. when she's back in a few weeks we're going to talk about accommodations. 

I mostly told her bc i'm really really going to stop acting allistic bc i don't care anymore bc i'm in a dead end position and my career is dead. and I just don't have the fucking energy anymore.
