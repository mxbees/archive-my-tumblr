I think one of the problems of how we talk about abuse,  especially online,  is that the classic models can't really account for dog piling.

like. one person being harassed by many strangers? they experience a repeated pattern of harm. abuse. 

but say it's a thousand different ppl who only make one nasty comment each. to what extent are they all individually the victim's abusers? 

(this is assuming no coordination or organizing efforts. just a thousand ppl maybe reacting to a single tweet with a horrible comment.  also assuming all else being equal. like one thousand cis white men saying something horrible to another visit white man. not that this is usually the case, but I want to examine the situation without worrying about other factors.) 

i just don't know. bc the person's subjective experience of abuse is,  I think,  entirely valid. but who is their abuser? I mean. each individual is guilty. but. is it the same as, say,  a lifetime of emotional abuse from a single person? how are these situations different?
