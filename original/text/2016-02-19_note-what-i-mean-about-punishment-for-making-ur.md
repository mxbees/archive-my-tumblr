note what i mean about 'punishment' for making ur own decisions.

i'm not talking about friends who'll blindly support whatever shitty decisions you want to make

but ones that recognize ur fundamental right to make it.

and when u do?

they don't punish you.

punishment isn't inclusive of another person setting their own boundaries and enforcing them (so if u make a decision that crosses their boundary and they decide that they need to step away for their own protection? that isn't *punishment*.) 

punishment is more along the lines of abuse. like attempting to coerce u into making a different decision (eg. if you do x, then i won't be ur friend anymore). or shaming u after the fact (eg. 'i told u so' or whatever variation).
