why is it that ppl who always defend theory being dense and inaccessible

always seem to forget that isn't always just about education and class?

like. u do get that there are ppl with, um, disabilities right?

disabilities that absolutely do render academic wank inaccessible?

but u just want to be smug and look smart.
