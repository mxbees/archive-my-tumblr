<p>i see my leelah post is bringing me lots of followers&#8230;.</p>

<p>u should be warned that i don&#8217;t normally bother with following normative grammar</p>

<p>i also don&#8217;t tend to sanitize my writing as much as i did for that post.</p>

<p>if u want to see where most of my long posts are, u can go to my <a href="http://b.binaohan.org">main blog</a></p>

<p>i also write books&#8230; more info can be found in <a href="http://biyuti.com/decol101">decolonizing trans/gender 101</a></p>
