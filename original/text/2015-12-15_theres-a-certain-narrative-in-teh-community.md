there's a certain narrative in teh community

(doesn't matter what gender)

of the young, repressed (but now out) queer just stepping into the community

and finding (sexual) guidance and tutelage in the arms and beds of older, experienced partners

somewhat tied to the whole romantic notion of classical greece

you're supposed to *want* this to some extent. to need it.

to welcome and embrace it.

and there's no shortage of older ppl waiting for the 

'fresh meat'[^1]
