title: on the conflation of abuse and oppression
---
So... I'm still processing the convo about abuse that was started last week. Given the dilution of the concept, it has become increasingly difficult to have any discussion of interpersonal harm without *everything* being abuse (or bullying).

It occured to me in the shower that one of the main problems, I think, is that we've come to conflate or equivocate between 'abuse' and 'oppression'. This isn't unsurprising because there are overlaps: abuse can be oppressive and oppression can be abusive. However, they are still distinct things such that if a person is being abusive they are not necessarily being oppressive and if a person is being oppressive they are not necessarily being abusive. But I often see the two terms being used interchangeably (or with the assumption that being or enacting one, means doing the other).

In very broad, general strokes we can see the distinction lies in the scope. Abuse is interpersonal (or at least by a defined group of people to an individual) and oppression is systemic and institutional (it goes from one class of people to another).

Obviously, since 'institutions' of oppression are really just the collective actions of individuals, it very much is the case that we have individuals oppressing other individuals. But I think there is room here to make a distinction between someone embodying and acting as an agent of institutionalized oppression and the interpersonal dynamics of abuse.

When oppression occurs between two instances of the respective classes (ie, two individuals), it isn't -- in some non-trivial way -- really about the individuals. For example, when people shout 'faggot' at me in the street, it isn't really about *me* as an individual. In this instance we are both just acting as representatives of our respective classes. The straight d00br0 in the car could be any given straight d00dbr0. Just like I can be just any given faggot.

A more pertinent example: this is why things like Oprah being told by a white shop owner that a purse is too expensive happen. Why? Because in this situation, Oprah isn't an individual. She's just any given Black woman. Just like the clerk isn't an individual. She's just any given white woman. And that's why these are *systems* of oppression. Because we are all reduced to interchangeable members of a class.[^1]

Abuse, on the other hand, is entirely about *you* as an individual. People might mobilize various marginalized characteristics in order to abuse you, but this isn't always the case (since oppressive dynamics set up an easy imbalance of power that abusers tend to exploit). But I think the key here is often the *imbalance of power* in and of itself. This is why, if you look for information about abuse, one of the most commons types you read about is child abuse.

Even so, an imbalance of power isn't a defining characteristic of abuse, and this is one of the main reasons I think conflating it with oppression is a mistake (since oppression is always about power). For example, we know that intimate partner violence (IPV) can occur in gay relationships. So we can have one white cis gay abusing another white cis gay (and all other things being equal).

At the very least, we can recognize that non-oppressive abuse exists. Similarly, non-abusive oppression exists[^2]. And so the two aren't interchangeable.

I think being clearer and more careful about when we invoke either term would help push back against the dilution of both.[^3]

[^1]: And I'm not trying to say that subjective experience isn't personal or harmful to you as a person. It is. It is incredibly painful every single time this happens, that your individuality, your humanity, is simply erased and you become Miscellaneous Asian #5.

[^2]: I feel like I need to offer an example of this. One easy example is the requirement, in many places, that trans women are sterilized before we can update our legal documentation. This is oppression, but it isn't abuse.

[^3]: This post isn't about me trying to... police how people understand their individual experiences. My policy will *always* be to believe ppl's claims of abuse (at least in the absence of more information). Rather, I'm hoping that by clarifying where I see a difference between the two, I (and others) will have a way to better contextualize and understand our experiences. In other words, this post is an attempt to describe a distinction I see, rather than make a proscriptive and normative claim as to what the distinction ought to be. Basically, I am *not* going to go around (and discourage others from doing so) and tell someone speaking of their abuse that, hey, no, this was actually oppression.
