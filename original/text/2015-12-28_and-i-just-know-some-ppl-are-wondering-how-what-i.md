and i just know some ppl are wondering how what i said yesterday is different than this

i don't care if ppl think i'm straight (just like i don't care if ppl think i'm white)

the point is, is that i know where i belong and where i don't.

and as long as i stay out of the places where i don't

then it doesn't matter what the ppl who do belong call me.

if trans lesbians don't want me in their space bc they think i'm straight

that's perfectly fine.

it isn't accurate, but what is accurate is that i'm not entitled to that space.

straight or third gender ladyboy who dates men. either way.

i don't belong.

and i haven't ever stayed around long enough to correct them

bc it doesn't. matter.
