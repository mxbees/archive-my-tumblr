<p>(probably because it is so fucking gross)</p>&#13;
<p>People who think that for something to count as abuse it needs to fulfill some arcane formula they decide on. </p>&#13;
<p>People who think their experiences are the authoritative measure for abuse. </p>&#13;
<p>People who watched a tv movie and think that abuse must be *visible* and *dramatic* for it to count. </p>&#13;
<p>People who use their experiences to silence yours. </p>&#13;
<p>People who think their personal experience makes them experts and, thus, qualified to make judgements about other people's experience. </p>&#13;
<p>People who do this fucking suck. </p>
