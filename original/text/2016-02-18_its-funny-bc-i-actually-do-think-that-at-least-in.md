it's funny bc i actually do think that at least in the most recent case, it wasn't intentional. 

more than anything, what interests me about all this is bc i've always been interested in intellectual history. 

and seeing, in real time, the transmission and spread of ideas is really fascinating. 

(it'd just be nice to feel like I'm not disappearing from it all even as I'm right here)
