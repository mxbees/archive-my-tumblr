i also just got a call from my credit card company

same transmisogynist tune:

me picking up my phone: 'hello?'

person: 'can i speak to ninx?

me: 'speaking.'

person: 'but is this a guy's name or...'

me: 'i am a woman'

person: 'oh....' \*asks me a million security questions\*

i answer them all and then....

person: 'ok. bye.' \*hangs up\*


me: wtf just happened. what was the point of that.

all this and they are *still* sending me mail using my deadname.

my e-statements are sent using my deadname.

how the fuck.
