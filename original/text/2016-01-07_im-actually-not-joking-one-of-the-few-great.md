I'm actually not joking. one of the few great things about Being An Adult is the ability to eat popcorn for dinner if you want. 

popcorn is on the list of about five things I can eat lately without feeling sick. and so I can choose something I like and can eat. without anyone trying to guilt me or coerce me into eating something else.
