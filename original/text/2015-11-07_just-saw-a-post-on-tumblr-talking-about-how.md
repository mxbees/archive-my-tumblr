just saw a post on tumblr talking about how writing (or at least most writers) are generally supported by someone who is not them. This particular one was supported by a husband. Others mentioned were independently wealthy.

and... tbh, even though that isn't my situation, there are two elements from there that i do have.

i'm poor, but my income is stable 

(as in, i always get the same number of hours every week and i rarely miss hours bc i decide when i go into work, so if i have appointments or whatever, i can just work on a different day. or if i need to travel, i can usually shift my workdays around so that i don't miss a single day)

i work part-time so i have lots of 'free' time

i basically spend about five days a week working on my writing and doing research and various tech things to support my writing. this is how i can write thousands of words a week.

like. this isn't the privileged life mentioned in that post bc i'm the sole income earner in my house. and have been for three years now. supporting two ppl on my part-time wages. but while money is stressful, i know all of my bills will be paid. maybe won't eat great some months. but. my bills are paid.

it really does make a difference.
