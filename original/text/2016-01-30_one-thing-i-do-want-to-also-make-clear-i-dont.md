one thing i do want to also make clear....

i don't actually blame ppl for taking two giant steps back and away

so that my stink and sin doesn't get on them

sure... i'm bitter and it destroyed me.

but i don't actually blame anyone.

this is also why i've been talking about survival

as something messy and ugly.

bc the reality is

i destroyed my career by trying to live up to my own principles

by trying to be good in the way i thought best

and fuck. do i ever not blame anyone who doesn't want this to happen to them
