sigh. someone on twitter was just talking about listening to nina simone for the first time....

god. i remember when i bought my first cd. like. fourteen years ago?

that particular cd/mix is still my fav

(thanks, autism, for ensuring that i tend to like one and only one album from most artists, and its usually the first one that i heard)

either way.

fuck. 

she'll always be one of my forever favourites.

she truly was a gift.
