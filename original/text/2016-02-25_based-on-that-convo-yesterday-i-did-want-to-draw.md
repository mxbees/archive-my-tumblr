based on that convo yesterday, i did want to draw out a few pertinent points.

in discussing the current issue with liang and the asian-american protests.

its true that i've seen a lot of asians lose sight of the central point.

bc this thing isn't about liang. its about Akai Gurley, the Black man he killed.

its about anti-Blackness and state violence (via the police).

its about the fact that ultimately, we as non-Black ppl think Black lives *don't* matter.

that's why, of all the possible ways in which asians aren't treated equal to whites, it is *this* particular issue that has us all upset.

like. liang is a scapegoat. if he were white he wouldn't have been convicted. blah blah blah.

everyday in small ways and large asians are oppressed by white supremacy. u don't have to look very hard to find some case, some incident in which asians were punished/treated differently than a white person.

so why *this* case. why *now*.

its bc Akai Gurley was a Black man and we don't think Black lives matter.

this is why that other post was apologism and a derail. the social conditions pointed out are true enough. but its largely irrelevant. all the things mentioned have been true for a while. they'll remain true for a while yet.
