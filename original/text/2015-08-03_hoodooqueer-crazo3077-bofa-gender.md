<p>&ldquo;Trans men are men&rdquo;<br>
Trans men- okay but this is the dumbest fucking opinion on tumblr</p>

<p>Trans man: I might be a man, but I&rsquo;m also assigned female at birth, giving me unique experiences from cis men. One thing is that I&rsquo;ve been viewed as female most of my life. Being viewed as female means I&rsquo;ve been treated as female. One treatment females receive is misogyny. Please don&rsquo;t tell me what my experiences are. </p><p>Queer theorists: LOL LOOK AT THIS TRANS BRO MISGENDERING HIMSELF.</p>

<p>I will always say that trans men often understand the treatment of women better than trans women, and to disregard a trans man&rsquo;s input is only going to hurt your perspective.<br></p>
