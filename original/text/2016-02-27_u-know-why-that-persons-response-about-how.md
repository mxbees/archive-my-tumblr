u know why that person's response about how abusers should just use resources designed for victims is shit?

ok.

let's talk about self-abuse (or self-harm. whatever).

i've read a bunch of resources to learn about why fat shaming is bad and harmful.

and yet i do it to myself everyday.

unlike before, i know that fat-shaming myself is harmful. so this is one good thing about the resources. 

however. learning why fatphobia and fatshaming are harmful has done very little to teach me how to *stop* doing it to *myself*. 

even resources for victims appear to generally be designed to... help us/them/we understand that what happened (or is happening) is Bad. but not nearly enough of them actually give some substantive, concrete steps for how to heal from it.

and part of the reason why is bc generic advice for this stuff doesn't really work. ppl are different and our experiences are different.

thus.... we should all have access to the support and resources we need for healing. whatever those needs are. generic posts on the interent are *not* sufficient. they are helpful but not even close to enough.
