<p>also&#8230;</p>

<p>comments on corporal punishment aren&#8217;t an invitation for a bunch of ppl to tell me that</p>

<p>'i was spanked and i think it is ok!'</p>

<p>like. good for u. yay.</p>

<p>note how i&#8217;m not even saying it is always bad/abusive.</p>

<p>again. there are cultural differences here that matter.</p>

<p>but me saying</p>

<p>'i don't think it is the most effective method of discipline'</p>

<p>is not me passing judgement on you and your experiences</p>

<p>(or, for any parents that read this who spank, i&#8217;m not judging how you raise your kids. i don&#8217;t know you and i don&#8217;t know your situation)</p>

<p>i will say it is interesting that i have to put this post here bc whenever ppl see a discussion about spanking, some ppl get really invested in asserting that they have every right and reason to hit kids.</p>

<p>and i&#8217;m not interested in having that discussion with anyone.</p>
