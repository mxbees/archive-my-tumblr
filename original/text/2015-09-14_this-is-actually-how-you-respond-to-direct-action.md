> Yesterday dozens of #TransLivesMatter activists took over the stage at the U.S. Conference on AIDS in Washington, DC, to draw attention to HIV-positive trans women and men as well as gender nonconforming people.

> Spokeswoman Bamby Salcedo, a Latina trans woman, activist, and subject of the documentary TransVisible, wore combat boots and looked ready for battle as she grabbed the microphone during the unexpected protest at the lunch-time plenary.

> The activists were applauded by the audience and welcomed by Paul Kawata, the executive director of the National Minority AIDS Council.

> In fact, Salcedo was allowed to speak for nearly 20 minutes as she outlined a list of actions the group called for, including a demand that the federal government set aside research money to study trans women and HIV. Despite the fact that trans women represent one of the highest at-risk populations they are rarely included in HIV studies, and when included they are frequently misgendered as men who have sex with men.

The only quibble I have is that in none of the signs or anything else does it appear that this group is organized under a banner of 'trans lives matter'. But this quibble is with the report, not Bamby Salcedo or the other twoc involved.
