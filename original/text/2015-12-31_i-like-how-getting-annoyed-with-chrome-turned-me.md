I like how getting annoyed with chrome turned me into abandoning browsers entirely. 

not sure how long I'll manage to keep it up. but. we'll see.

i just need to work out a few details and i'll be able to keep up with friends without having to log into tumblr. which means I'll end up missing a bunch of stuff.
