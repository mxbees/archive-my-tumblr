wow. i just wrote my first post explicitely discussing 'decolonization' in a long while....

discussing why i don't really talk about it anymore and why, for the most part, i don't think the current discourse around it is worth engaging.

now that i've organized my thoughts about this, i don't think i'll call the 2nd edition of _decolonizing trans/gender 101_ 'decolonizing trans/gender 101'. lol.
