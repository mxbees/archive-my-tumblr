re: something that just crossed my dash

radfems don't always overtly say stuff about trans women.

like. one of their normal rhetorical devices is using 'female' as a noun.

(it is fairly common to see 'female' used as an adjective by all kinds of cis feminists, 'female librarian')

but as a noun?

95% chance its a radfem. and when they say 'female' they mean cafab.
