as i was doing my weekly chores. i was thinking about my... idk internal ableism (ie resistance to the idea that i'm chronically ill). 

i think part of it is that i know many ppl who're chronically ill that're worse off than i am. but... that's not the point is it? bc i'm not 'less' disabled bc someone is 'more'. i'm disabled bc i can't do what *able* ppl can do. the fact that i can do more than some of my friends is irrelevant. i need to keep this in mind.

the fact is. is that my current workload is about the most i can do and feel good. 

quite possibly, i *could* do more. but it would cost me.

here's an average day for me:

wake up around 5-6. spend 2-3 hrs catching up on news/writing and drinking coffee. at this point i'm usually caffeinated enough to take a shower. eat some food. write some more. at about 11 or so, fatigue will set in. i'll spend the rest of the day fighting off sleep, occassionally passing out, trying to write. around 14-15 i usually stop bc i'm fucking done. so i'll go lie down to get the energy to wash the dishes and make dinner. i'll do that. eat dinner. then i'm back in bed listening to audiobooks until about 21. get ready for bed. sleep usually by 22.

i maybe average writing about 2k-3k words a day. somedays i write less bc i have to get groceries. or run other errands. 

that's me about five days a week.

the other two days i go to my day job to work for 8.5 hrs.

in my home i:

- do most of the cooking
- do most of the cleaning (dishes 4 days a week; sweeping, cleaning the kitchen, cleaning the washroom once a week)
- i'm the only person with an income. which means i can't miss shifts at work. and i *have* to keep writing so that ppl don't stop supporting me on patreon.
- i run most of the errands (ie, grocery shopping, ensuring other household items are in stock like toilet paper, etc.)

and this is why i haven't been able to fit biyuti publishing into my life. obvs some days i have less spoons than others. some weeks i can't do all of my chores. some days my executive dysfunctioning ensures that i do nothing.

i feel tired all the time. i feel overwhelmed all the time. i always feel like i'm balancing on a razor's edge over the canyon we call 'burnout'. i'm actually about 90% sure that i *did* burn out a few years ago. but had to keep fucking going anyway.

death often seems like the only way i'll be able to escape this fucking grind. i want a break. i want to rest. 

anyway. i'm really writing this for me. bc i need to be better about recognizing how hard i work and the toll it takes on me.
