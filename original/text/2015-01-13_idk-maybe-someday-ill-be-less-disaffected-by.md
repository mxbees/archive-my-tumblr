<p>idk.</p>

<p>maybe someday i&#8217;ll be less disaffected by the shit on tumblr to</p>

<p>maybe actually get into the conversation about why certain topics are perceived as sancrosact</p>

<p>i mean&#8230;.</p>

<p>o</p>

<p>i&#8217;m probably a terrible example for anyone to follow bc i talk a lot about shit that i&#8217;d probably be better off keeping my mouth shut about.</p>

<p>esp. since i often talk about stuff where&#8230; i&#8217;m the oppressor.</p>

<p>and maybe i need to take several steps back and re-think what i talk about and what i engage.</p>

<p>but of course. it is one of those things where u can never win, in the end. bc if u focus narrowly on talking ONLY about stuff that actually impacts u, u end up erasing and tacitely being complicit in other ppl&#8217;s oppression.</p>

<p>eh.</p>

<p>i don&#8217;t fucking know.</p>

<p>i feel like quitting everything.</p>

<p>no more blogging. no more books. nothing.</p>

<p>(this is not a plea for anyone to tell me how important my writing is. it isn&#8217;t that important. very little of what i write is new or novel. and many ppl are better writers than me)</p>
