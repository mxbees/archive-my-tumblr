title: a short history of 'third gender'

<blockquote>&#13;
<p><strong>Anonymous: totally didn't know third gender was a culture-specific, appropriateable thing. what's the history of the term?</strong></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>(my reply)</p>&#13;
<p>According to the article "<a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_lesbian_and_gay_studies/v008/8.4towle.html">Romancing the Transgender Native</a>": </p>&#13;
<blockquote>The term third gender was apparently introduced in 1975 by M. Kay Martin and Barbara Voorhies, who employed it to draw attention to the ethnographic evidence that gender categories in some cultures could not be adequately explained with a two-gender framework.</blockquote>&#13;
<p>I've not been able to get my hands on the 1975 chapter where the term is introduced... but I'll make the article available later for those people interested in reading it, especially since it works both as a good critique of this anthro term and from how the trans community has appropriated it. (h/t to a-bayani for suggesting this article)</p>&#13;
<p>Nonetheless, this paragraph alone demonstrates just how and why the term is not only racist when coming from white people, but how it is also white supremacist. </p>&#13;
<p>The coining of the term clearly demonstrates that these white researchers assume the supremacy and the a priori validity of their western/white binary gender system. (having a 'third' gender makes zero sense if your culture has always had more than two -- why would we call it 'third' if it is traditional?)</p>&#13;
<p>However, the term isn't necessarily culture specific since white people used it to describe and conflate vastly different genders they deemed 'other' based on their own cultural gender expectations. More than anything 'third gender' seems to describe any non-white/non-western gender beyond its borders. It signifies 'other' more than anything else. </p>&#13;
<p>This is why, for me at least, I think that any non-white non-binary person has a right to use the term if they wish to reclaim it. But it is also why white gq people shouldn't use the term, ever. </p>&#13;
<p>If you read the article (but I'll summarize some points), you'll see that the later history of the term comes to be that white people like Kate Borstein come to romantise and appropriate 'third genders' in their politics. The existence and experiences of non-white third gender people come to be used as an almost continual rhetorical point that many white trans and/or genderqueer people seem content to use in their arguments against a binary gender system. </p>&#13;
<p>People like me end up being a footnote to some white gq's 'libratory' discourse. </p>&#13;
<p>tl;dr 'third gender' is a racist term coined by a racist discipline to describe and exotify non-white gender identities. </p>
