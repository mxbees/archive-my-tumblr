i think one of the things that bothers me most about disability in fiction

(as written by ppl who usually don't have that disability)

is that the ppl are so often in denial, angry, or insistant that they be able to do everything on their own and rely on no one

these ppl?

they almost always have access to healthcare that i one day *dream* of having.

like. they have multiple treatment options. all the doctors, meds, etc that they need. but then they'll be like 'i don't want healthcare bc it means admitting i have a disability' or 'i don't need anyone'

so many examples, but i think my least favourite is chronic pain in fiction. usually these people are always like 'i don't need pain meds i'm fine' or they do everything to avoid taking them. 

and wheni think of all the ppl i know who have chronic pain and are unable to access any meaningful kind of healthcare that might help them manage it. just makes me mad.
