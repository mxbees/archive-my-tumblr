today's appointment with the liver specialist was essentially useless.

i sit down. wait an hour and a bit past my appoitment time.

get into the office. they weigh me. take my blood pressure.

doctor finally comes in.

him: so. it looks like your liver is fat.

me: ...

him: your ultrasound confirmed this. it isn't too bad, though. but there isn't any treatment other than diet and exercise.

me: ...

him: have any questions?

me, internally: **s c r e a m i n g**

i walked into that office knowing my liver was fatty. and that bc the medical industry doesn't care about the health of anyone the perceive as overweight or fat, no one has bothered researching this particular thing.

so the only 'treatment' is.... diet and exercise.

but why, pray tell, did i have to spend hours of my time going to various appointments only to be told what i already knew?

why are doctors so fucking useless?
