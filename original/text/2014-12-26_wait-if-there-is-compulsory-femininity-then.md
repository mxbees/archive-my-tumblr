<p>wait&#8230; if there is compulsory femininity</p>

<p>then this means that being butch is necessarily resistance to this</p>

<p>and then this means that butches are inherently more radical/revolutionary than femmes</p>

<p>gosh.</p>

<p>i swear&#8230;</p>

<p>this sounds EXACTLY LIKE the typical white discourse around gender and masculinity</p>

<p>(both queer and not-queer)</p>

<p>i mean&#8230;</p>

<p>obviously butches are more valuable bc of their revolutionary expression and resistance to compulsory femininity&#8230;</p>

<p>this means we ought to centre them in our discourse and spaces!</p>
