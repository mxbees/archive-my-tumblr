it, ultimately, isn't surprising given that my brain tends to favour the meta level of analysis.

when i was doing logic, i primarily focused on meta-logic and the philosophy of logic (with some sprinkles on the history of logic)

likewise, i think like... at least half of my posts about ethics are actually meta-ethics.

just how my brain works, i guess.
