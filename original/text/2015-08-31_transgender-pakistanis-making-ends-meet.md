title: Transgender Pakistanis - Making ends meet

>Khan has been lucky to land a job in the Social Welfare Department. She works in Karachi with Bindiya Rana, the founder of the Gender Interactive Alliance (GIA) — an organisation working for the equality and civil rights of transgender people in Pakistan — and runs a small home-based clothing business. “I have been denied all the opportunities I deserved even though I have the required level of education,” Khan claims. “I have a double Masters, yet I am only paid Rs15,000 per month and I have been forced to leave every job I have ever had.”

>While some members of the community are denied employment, others are not given the salaries they are owed. Rimsha, for instance, has been employed at the Clifton Cantonment Board since 2010. Her salary has been slowly increased over five years, spurred by protests organised by Rana, and she is now paid Rs15,000, an amount that is largely spent on transportation every month. “There are so many others like me, and when they can’t make ends meet they find other ways to earn money, such as begging,” says Rimsha. Since 2010, Rimsha has been ‘on probation’ and her contract is renewed as needed. “According to the labour laws someone working for you for three months should be considered a permanent employee,” argues Khan.

>Rana explains that the community can only progress if it can sustain itself. “We need loans to be able to start businesses, so we can get off the streets,” Rana says. It is only through employment that the community can end a reliance on sex work, and thereby curb, the threat of HIV and AIDS, she feels. “If we were able to run restaurants or beauty parlours, we could give opportunities to others who are not as educated.”
