man. i just did some poking around looking to see what it'd cost to get myself health insurance.

so. expensive.

not to say that some of them wouldn't be beneficial, given the monthly cost of my prescriptions.


but if i want dental and vision too? it's like... 00/month.

i went to check a different one and i have a pre-existing condition that makes me ineligable.


and this condition? major depression. lmao.
