although, i'd be willing to grant my east asian interlocutors the korea thing.


def. not on the same level as china and japan.

i still encourage ppl to learn the dif. between imperialism and colonialism, though.

half tempted to also dig into the ways that an e. asian calling me 'racist' is accurate.

and the ways that white ppl have always preferred yellow ppl over brown...

the science behind this all. blah blah blah.

there are distinct historical reasons why a lot of ppl equate 'asian' with 'east asian'

(relating to scientific racism and white supremacy... but. i have better things to do today. so.)
