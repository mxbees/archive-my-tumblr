title: can we just move on already?
---
I think we should all understand that we're quickly reaching the point where liberal identity politics, you know the ones devoid of any analysis of power, are creating a situation where anyone should be allowed to enter any space bc of reasons.

It is utterly bizarre to me that it remains and continues to be an ongoing 'dicussion' about whether or not cis straight ppl are 'queer' or belong under the 'lgbt' umbrella. 

It is utterly bizarre to me that ppl still think that 'queer' and 'lgbt+' refer to the same group of people.

That queer isn't a slur and can be used by anyone and everyone.

And yet...

And yet.

To answer my own question: no, we can't move on.

The point of all of this is dilution, distraction, and discord.
