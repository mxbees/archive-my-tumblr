but i guess the question is:

is there a level of oppression (in this case disability)

so profound such that we can perceive the person as incapable of making ethical decisions? of moral reasoning? such that they are free from an expectation to be ethical?

i'm inclined to think 'no'.

especially not when such arguments are literally what fuels the infantilization of disabled people and why many are not considered fully human enough to be agents capable of self-determination.
