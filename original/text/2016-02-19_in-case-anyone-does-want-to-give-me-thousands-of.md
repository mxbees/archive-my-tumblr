in case anyone does want to give me thousands of dollars to educate them on a thing.

here's what i'm qualified for teaching:

'western' logic (intro and/or philosophy of). Chinese logic. Chinese intellectual history (I could do pre-modern period but especially the Warring States). Information literacy. Chinese philosophy of the Warring States (subdivide into any of the 'major' schools: Daoism, Confucianism, or Mohism). Last... I could probably teach an intro class to Classical Chinese (ie, language instruction).

send me money and i'll pick a textbook. devise lesson plans. create assignments, exams, etc. evaluate you.
