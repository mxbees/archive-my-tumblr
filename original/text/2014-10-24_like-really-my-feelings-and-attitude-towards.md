<p>like&#8230;</p>

<p>really. my feelings and attitude towards iaopoc spaces</p>

<p>as a light skin mestisa</p>

<p>changes</p>

<p><em>all the time</em></p>

<p>bc i just don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>esp. since yes. some do read me as white. and those are the people i care about.</p>

<p>as nice as it is to hear from friends and ppl i trust</p>

<p>that they don&#8217;t see me this way</p>

<p>(like, yeah, not that many ppl have seen how i look)</p>

<p>and it is like hugely satisfying that i don&#8217;t look like a white person to them</p>

<p>this just means that</p>

<p>(thank the ancestors)</p>

<p>they aren&#8217;t the ones i might hurt by existing in certain kinds of spaces</p>

<p>fuck. i even try to do a lot of my processing outside of tumblr and just in my head</p>

<p>bc sometimes i feel like posts like this might come off as me wanting friends to reassure me that</p>

<p>'no, your one of the good ones!'</p>

<p>which is not at all what i want.</p>

<p>but after recent experiences with some white coding ppl</p>

<p>i&#8217;m starting to think that i&#8217;m also doing <em>them</em> a disservice by not</p>

<p>publicly talking about how to not act like a shitty entitled white person</p>

<p>and how to centre darker skinned iaopoc in how we do things.</p>

<p>bc this shit actually needs to be discussed.</p>

<p>and a lot less mixed-with-white tears that i see</p>
