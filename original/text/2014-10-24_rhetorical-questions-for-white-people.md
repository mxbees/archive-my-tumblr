<p>For those deeply and truly concerned about being anti-racist and checking their shit...</p>&#13;
<p>How prepared and comfortable are you with the notion that even if you do everything right, some PoC/non-white/Indigenous people will never trust, like, or love you? That some may always hate your whiteness and all the privilege that comes with it? </p>&#13;
<p>Are you prepared to not travel to non-white countries if there isn't a good, ethical way to do so?</p>&#13;
<p>Are you prepared to stop doing yoga, stop getting tattoos and other body mods, etc.? </p>&#13;
<p>If you are doing area studies of non-white ares (i.e., Asian studies, etc.) are you prepared to change your major? Career? </p>&#13;
<p>Are you really able and willing to accept that some spaces will never be for you and that you are unwelcome there? </p>&#13;
<p>I wonder... (but seriously, these question are rhetorical)</p>
