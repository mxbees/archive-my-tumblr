lol. someone is annoyed that i used 'yellow' as a way to describe a race...

that apparently this needs to be blanked out bc its... offensive? or something?

first. learn something about the history of racism.

second. think really hard about the processes by which 'asians' are the only non-white race to have mostly left behind its 'colour'.

third. good job using the image of a Black person for your 'reaction' to my post. bc that isn't ironic at all.

last: 'yellow' isn't offensive. so long as Black people are called 'Black', asians are going to fucking suck it up re: yellow. if Black ppl have to deal with being reduced to a colour. so do we. we aren't special or better than them.
