although... it was interesting talking to the surgeon.

same old 'so, u have a cpap machine?'

me 'no, i can't afford one'

as i'm doing a consultation that cost *half* the price of one

for a surgery that'll cost 0k if it happens.

priorities? lol.

(but actually, i *might* get funding for tits but i'm definitely not 'wasting' my money on 'vanity'/dysphoria rather than getting myself necessary medical equipment.
