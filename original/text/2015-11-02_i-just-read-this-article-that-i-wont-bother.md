i just read this article (that i won't bother linking to since it is transmisogynist garbage) that highlighted one specific thing that i see certain kinds of feminists say all the time.

this is the false notion that transmisogyny within (and without) of feminism is an 'old ppl' thing that will die out once the crusty white ladies like greer die.

much like the notion that millenials are somehow less racist than their parents or grandparents, this isn't going to happen.

this one of the reasons why i *repeatedly* try to make the point that transmisogyny really is, as my tag for this topic says, 'fun for the whole family'. groups on the left, center, and right buy into it. young ppl, middle aged ppl, old ppl buy into it.

don't hold ur breath waiting for it to magically disappear.
