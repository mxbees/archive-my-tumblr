title: 5 Reasons Why Millenials Won't Make Eye Contact
---
Millenials are spoiled, lazy, and entitled. They also don't make eye contact. This is a generation obsessed with their phones and devices. As a result, they've become unable to follow some of the basic rules of social etiquette.

Have you been to a public space recently and seen how they behave in groups? There'll be an entire group of youngsters sitting together and, instead of looking one another in the eye, they'll all be doing whatever it is that millenials do on their phones. It's ridiculous and its absurd.

But why is this happening?

Here are five reasons why millenials won't make eye contact:

###1) Spinal deformities

You know all the looking down and staring at phones? Turns out that if you do this long enough, you actually permanently change the curvature of your spine.

Millenials are the first generation raised with smartphones and other portable electronics. They've grown up holding these devices in their hands and staring at them for most of the day. As a result, straightening their necks to look someone in the eye actually causes them physical pain or discomfort.

So have some compassion! Just as Gen Xers struggled with things like carpal tunnel, this is simply something that'll become more and more prevalant.

###2) Selfies

While selfies are usually used as evidence for why millenials are so narcissistic (which they are), it also has an unintended consequence for their ability to make eye contact.

Between this and video calls over the Skype, millenials have normalized a type of eye contact that is always just slightly off centre. Owing to the fact that looking directly into the camera (which would constitute eye contact in a video call) means not being able to see themselves in the corner of the call where the Skype typically shows what their own camera is picking up.

And for those who aren't that narcissistic? The problem remains, because looking at the screen instead of the camera means that they've normalized a situation where looking *at* someone, but not making eye contact, is the same as actually making eye contact.

###3) Helicopter parents

We all know that millenials are the most coddled generation. This is part of what feeds their entitlement. Also why they want to be shielded from uncomfortable situations by slapping trigger warnings over everything.

Given that they've been raised by helicopter parents who micromanage their every movement and instill many normal, everyday things with a sense of terror and danger, millenials have learned that eye contact does constitute as 'talking to strangers'.

While not talking to strangers is sound advice for children, the problem is that many millenials are living in eternal adolescence and refusing to grow up and leave the nest. As such, they are never able to move beyond this childish belief that making eye contact with strangers will lead to their kidnapping and/or murder.

###4) Irony

We know that millenials via hipsters love irony. This is a group of people who were raised with shows like the Office, Parks and Recreation, and other such comedies. As a result, they've come to understand that looking directly at the camera (eg, another person's eyes) should only be done when needed for comedic effect.

So while it is a bit of an overstatement to say that millenials never make eye contact, because they do, you should pay close attention at the times when they make eye contact. Very likely, there'll be something humourous or ironic about the situation (or at least something they think is humourous).

The other impace on this, especially between millenials, is that they know that if someone is making eye contact with them, there is a large possibility that they are being made fun of in some fashion or other. It turns out that if you get through an interaction without a millenial making eye contact with you, this is means you've had a successful interaction. The millenial has taken you as seriously as they can take anything (which, admittedly isn't all that serious, but its a start).

###5) The Void

Given the context in which millenials have grown up. Surrounded by technology. The world accelerating towards ecological destruction. Meaningless and endless wars both actual and figurative. A constant barrage of information and distraction. The realization that they may never stop working at the coffee shop they started at during college to help pay their way, regardless of how many degrees they have. The endless hours spent living in their parent's basement. The hollow empty consumption of goods as a way to replace meaning and work in their lives. The many manufactured social crises they continually rant about (like racism). The crushing weight of student loans and other debt.

Millenials don't make eye contact because they are usually staring into The Void.

It is the empty space borne out of disillusionment and selfies. It is what consumes them and fuels their narcissism and sense of entitlement (The Void demands all the things). It is where their social skills and sense of respect have vanished.

It is The Void.
