<p>soooo&#8230;</p>

<p>here is a thing i find interesting. i reblogged two posts by disabledqueerdyke today about Rita Hester.</p>

<p>one mentions that TDoR was created in response to her murder</p>

<p>and the other notes that we need to recognize that the Black community has a lot to do with knowledge of her life and death</p>

<p><em>one</em> of these posts has 200+ notes and the other? 28 (at this moment)</p>

<p>can u guess which one?</p>

<p>i hope all the ppl who&#8217;re reblogging one, but not the other recognize that their anti-Blackness is showing.</p>

<p>could u be more transparent?</p>
