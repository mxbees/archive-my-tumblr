re: someone's comment about gravity falls and anti-Blackness... YES. sooo many problems.

also... i can't decide if one of mabel's friends is transmisogynist or not. 

bc i'm pretty sure that the 'punchline' with that friend is that she's a girl with a deep, raspy voice and it really fucking gets to me.
