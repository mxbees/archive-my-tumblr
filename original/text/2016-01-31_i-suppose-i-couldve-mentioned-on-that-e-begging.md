i suppose i could've mentioned on that e-begging post

that i pretty much always meet my fundraising goal.

there isn't a fool-proof formula or anything.

but overtime, those things are what i've found make a big difference.

it also usually takes me about a day or two to raise the money i need.

but... sorry for trying to help some ppl out with trying to increase their success with e-begging.

its funny. for all that i say i'm a petty person...

i'm not the kind of petty that leaves an asinine comment on a post trying to help ppl.
