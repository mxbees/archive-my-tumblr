hm. i also don't think ppl realize how basically destroying your entire life can bring certain kinds of clarity.

one of the anons i blocked asked me what i've ever done.

nothing. i do nothing. at least nothing that matters to a lot of ppl.

i have a very narrow and limited idea of what 'success' is for me. or even what i'm hoping to accomplish.

pretty much the only goal i have in life rn is: don't die.

every day that i keep breathing is victory for me.

in terms of my writing and philosophy.... i do it bc my ancestors want me to. 

my life certainly doesn't want for meaning, even if i despair at times.

i'm nothing and i have nothing to prove and nothing to defend.

there's a certain kind of freedom in this.
