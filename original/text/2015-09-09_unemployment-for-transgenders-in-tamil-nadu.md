title: Unemployment for Transgenders in Tamil Nadu
---
> There are close to 35,000 trangenders in Tamil Nadu, but not even a fraction of them can claim to have a regular stream of employment from a recognised organisation or a proper establishment. Though employment and lack of societal support are issues that have been plaguing the trangender community for a long time now, they are ready with solutions.

> “Besides the lack of reservation in state education and employment, there is also the ever present problem of not being able to even find a home. No landlord wants to give a home for rent to a transgender,” said Dhanam, a transgender activist who runs the NGO Snegidhi.
