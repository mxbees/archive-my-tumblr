<p>Seriously, white people. Whether or not you should step into any conversation on racism is something you really need to think about.</p>&#13;
<p>But in a conversation about and occurring between different PoC groups, you really, really don't have a place.</p>&#13;
<p>And if you are gonna step into the conversation, positioning yourself like you are part of one group or as if you have a right to speak for that group, is pretty gross.</p>&#13;
<p>Fucking white people. </p>&#13;
