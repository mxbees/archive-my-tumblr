this post is to record the moment i knew that my career was Officially Dead.

the story starts with this [job posting for a Digital Projects Librarian][job]. i applied for this job. i didn't get an interview. fuck, i didn't even get an email acknowledging that i'd applied at all. as far as i know, i tossed my resume into the void (or, more likely, this is what they did).

i told myself when i applied, 'if i don't even get an interview, i'll know for sure that i'm as unemployable as i've been saying' and behold!

i am unemployable in my field.

you might ask yourself (if you bothered to read the job ad) why this was the Definitive Test for me.

why?

as it happens 'digital projects librarian' is my current job title. just part-time. i have all of the qualifications. and 95% of the preferred qualifications are my actual job. like. literally what i do when i'm at work. the other stuff? like the last one? i've been teaching myself ruby for the past few years. and so on.

i applied using, as a foundation, the exact cover letter that bagged me an interview the last time i applied for a job with U of T.

no response.

normally, when i haven't got a position, it usually goes to someone with more experience or better suited experience. for this job? lol. no. you know who got the job? somone who literally graduated *last year* and this is their first professional job. compared to me, someone whose been in the field for four years and meets all the qualifications. 

so here's my recipe for becoming unemployable:

step 1: be a poor, disabled, trans pinay  
step 2: destroy your reputation by taking an ethical stance in a field dominated by Nice White Ladies(tm)

viola. one dead career.

anyway. this is reminding me that the mcdonald's down the street is hiring and i should apply.
