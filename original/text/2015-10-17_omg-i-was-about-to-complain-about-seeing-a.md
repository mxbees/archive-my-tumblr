omg. i was about to complain about seeing a certain white trans woman that i hate on my dash

(on one of her posts)

until i remembered that my irl identity is now tied to this pseud and i don't want to get sued again. :D

just as a heads up: from this point on, if i have something 'shitty' to say about someone, it'll be vague blogging.

like. i know i'll find ways to still get my points across, but i am not opening myself up to another lawsuit.

once was more than enough.
