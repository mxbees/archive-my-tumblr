you know how i got all of my school work done and on time?

by literally forcing myself to spend like, eight hours a day, six days a week

sitting at a cafe with my study materials

i'd spend maybe, at most, 3 hours of that time actually *doing* things

the rest would be me distracted or unable to get myself to start.

essentially, i learned that if i wanted to get one hour of work accomplished, i needed to schedule like... three or four if i actually wanted to do one hour of work.

result: yes. i did everything on time and without having to stress about last minute anything.

result: i had zero spoons leftover for socializing. or a lot of self-care. or really much of anything else. and, yes, i did eventually burn out. i was also a fucking mess, mentally, all of which got progressively worse and worse every year that i did this because i had zero energy to devote to um, actually dealing with my mental illnesses and trauma. my entire life was attending classes, studying, and working. that's pretty much it. for almost... ten years. and now that i'm out of school i'm barely a functional human being bc of this.
