so i think i managed to work myself up into an existential crisis or whatever about my writing.

idk. i do get that not everyone enjoys reading longer essays. i mean. i do get it. i often have difficulty maintaining my concentration and focus to get through long bits of writing.

everytime i tell ppl, though, that write now what my brain wants to do is write long essays, ppl are like 'but is anyone reading them?'. idk. maybe not.

maybe more ppl would buy them if i made them into zines... but i'm planning on putting out an anthology at the end of the year. so ppl can buy that.

i'm also becoming convinced (again) that my main blog should not be on tumblr. it was a lot easier to not obsess over my notifications when i was doing my original writing elsewhere and crossposting to tumblr.

tumblr's dash is also jsut fucking awful for things longer than, idk, 700 words or so?

idk. what do.
