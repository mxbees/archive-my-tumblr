<p>it is hard not to see those graphic descriptions of violence</p>

<p>against marginalized ppl</p>

<p>as some kind of gore porn for oppressors</p>

<p>like&#8230; u want a really good example of this?</p>

<p>read the stories about Mayang Prasetyo (big fuck TW on the stories about her though)</p>

<p>yes, the racist and transmisogynist aspects are troubling&#8230;.</p>

<p>but few ppl talk about how the gory, sensationalized descriptions of death are just&#8230;.</p>
