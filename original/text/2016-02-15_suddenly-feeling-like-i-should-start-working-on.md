suddenly feeling like I should start working on being a better writer. like. start editing before I post? 

idk. I like just writing and then posting. but. if I'm going to be serious about treating this like a job, I should maybe start working on improving? 

most of the writing things I see are mostly about fiction. how does one get better at writing nonfiction (other than practising since I write often ebough).
