<p>omg. and since messaging is only for primary blogs and this one is a secondary, so ppl won’t be able to IM me. which is a relief bc i can’t really deal with synchronous convos very well.</p>

<p>I’ve been able to do it from sideblogs, but I think you can toggle off messenger in a blog’s settings.</p>

i see what the problem is. if you have a side blog with more than one person, you can't use IMs for that account.
