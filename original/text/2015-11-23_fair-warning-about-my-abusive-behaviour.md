title: fair warning about my abusive behaviour
---
In accidentally clicking some of the tags associated with my username, I've learned yet another new way to be called abusive...

In this case it was: mentioning that a person was part of a group is abusive (bc they group abused them).

Last week we also saw: Criticizing someone's theory is abuse.

But also: Mentioning one of your interpersonal conflicts and a way to mark you biases is also abuse.

And last but not least: Not liking a person (and saying why) is also abuse.

Of course, people have every right to frame any harm I might've done to them as abuse. I'm not disputing that.

Just wanted ppl to make note. This isn't intending to defend myself from their claims. I will *always* think that we should err on the side of victims.

But. Um. I guess I really just want ppl to know that I don't feel bad about any of the above. So if you do think such things qualify as abuse and/or you do want to err on the side of victims, now you know. 

Please take whatever steps you feel necessary for your own safety.
