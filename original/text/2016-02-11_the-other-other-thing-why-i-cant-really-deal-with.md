the other other thing why i can't really deal with most discussions about disability and eugenics today, is that... most of these ppl don't really appear capable of the type of nuance needed to have this conversation.

like that post i reblogged? was talking about embryos and/or fetuses.

ppl get that embryos don't actually have rights, right?

like. screening fetuses based on 'desirable' physical characteristics is disgusting, but ppl have every right to do this. and to decide to not have (or have) whatever babies they wish to have.

why? bc the reproductive rights of baby carriers trump the non-rights of embryos or fetuses.

i mean. yes. its disgusting but... what are people suggesting as the alternative? that ppl *not* be allowed to make these decisions about their bodies?

the other other thing that these ppl seem to miss out on is that, as far as 'undesirable' physical characteristics are concerned, people who have babies literally *cannot* win.

if they decide, as they have every right to, that they do not wish to bear this child or carry it to term bc of a fear of disability, people like that person feel like they are allowed to criticism them or shame them for their decision.

if they decide, however, to knowingly bear a child that they know *beforehand* will be disabled, they also get shamed (for being selfish, for having a baby they 'know' will be miserable, for creating a drain on society, etc.)

like. do ppl not realize that many people who might otherwise give birth to a disabled child face a great deal of social pressure to *not* have that child? and your response is to, what? pressure them into having that child?

this is an unwinnable situation because it appears that everyone wants to have an opinion or a say in who has what babies, and so you're damned if you do and if you don't.

that particular post, the 'solution' appears to be calling this practice eugenics. and while it is eugenics what, exactly, does it accomplish to point to prospective parents and say 'this is eugenics'? ultimately, it *doesn't matter* if this is why a parent chooses to not have a child. its gross. but its irrelevant. 

at the end of the day, hypothetical people do not have rights over people actually alive today.
