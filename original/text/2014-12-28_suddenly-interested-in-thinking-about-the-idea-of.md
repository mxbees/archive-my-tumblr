suddenly interested in thinking about the idea of werewolves as proxy for autism...

like.

thinking about a lot of the werewolf stories I hear that involve new werewolves and how a lot of their initial problem is all about being overwhelmed and overstimulated by their senses....

and how they have meltdowns and have social problems arising from this....
