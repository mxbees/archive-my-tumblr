i very much know what its like to have a bunch of ppl 

approach you in private with flattery about how 'brave' or whatever the fuck u are

but when its important?

when it becomes necessary?

when success or failure really depends on cooperation?

ur very much alone.

and ppl will be happy to stand by and watch

once you've fallen

they'll come back to say 

'i told u so'
