I find tumblr's culture around 'expertise' super kind of interesting. I mean. People truly believe that no one on here has any level of expertise or deep knowledge in certain areas. Everything is an 'opinion' even when it takes a two minute google search to verify some statements. Some take a bit more time but... the information is out there on many of these topics. But not just 'information' any and all fields have competing theories and disagreements. And... tbh, sometimes it can take years to really gain significant knowledge and insight into an area. Indeed, many people spend many years doing just this.

Now. I know that some of the problem with why there is a general perception that every tumblr user is just spouting ignorant opinions. Reasons to do with misogyny, since tumblr in its early days had a majority of women/girls using it. Reasons to do with age, since the demographics of tumblr skews younger than many other networks.

This at least explains how people interact with some of us outside of tumblr. Its the reason why TiA thought the fact that I am a 'philosophy major' discredits my writing about logic. As far as they are concerned, I'm probably a 16 year old girl whose too stupid to live.

But this perception impacts how tumblr users interact with other tumblr users.

In general, there are two competing modes for how a person establishes their authority on a subject. The first is the traditional, mainstream way of listing credentials or formal education. The second, borne out of resistance to the first, is by invoking some notion of authentic, first-hand experience. There are issues with both.

I find it interesting though, when you deal with a certain group of people who do not think the second mode of establishing authority is valid. For these people, speaking from your experience is to merely articulate an opinion. From what I can tell, many people on tumblr assume that this is the average Tumblr's primary mode.

But then... they occassionally bump into someone who, if needed, can establish their authority using the first mode (ie, by listing some sort of Offical Credential). And when these people encounter someone who, at least by mainstream society, is recognized as an authority on a subject, they still do their best to just... scoff away at it (much like a bunch of teens mocking Toni's PhD subject area). It tends to be a way to shift the goal posts. Toni can't know anything about racism bc her PhD is in sociology. I can't know anything about logic because my MA is in philosophy.

Of course, for people who actually know things about either field, it should be fairly evident that only someone entirely ignorant would assert a position like this. Or... there's another motivation, yeah? Beyond ignorance, there is (and always has been) a need for relatively privileged people to frame those they oppress as less intelligent. As stupid. As incapable of higher reasoning or rational thought.

And so... I get to be amused by a white d00dbr0 on reddit laughing at my posts about logic because they think I'm a 'philosophy major'. Or I get to deal with random people making fun of a post I write about information literacy... despite the fact that I have a masters degree in Information Science. Toni gets to deal with people who think her 'opinions' about racism are wrong because sociology.

And, no, I don't think having Credentials(tm) mean anything in terms of authority or expertise in an area. The only thing that a credential tells me that's meaningful (imo) is how much *time* someone has spent focused on a particular area. It is, tbh, really just an objective measure of time spent studying a subject. You don't need to be in school to spend six years studying logic and anyone who's spent as much time (or more) is just as 'expert' in it as I am.

But am I going to spend a lot of time entertaining the opinions of people who haven't even spent a fucking hour studying logic? No. I have better things to do. Moreover, because of the time I've spent learning the things I know, I don't have anything to prove to anyone.

So no. I won't spend time educating people on subjects where they won't even allow for the possibility that I could know more about it than they do. Or even just know things that they don't. Not when I have the Credentials(tm) to teach certain subjects at the college level. You want an intro class to logic? Pay the going rate of, what, a couple thousand a semester?[^1] 

Its a curious thing. And the entire 'dilemma' is designed so that, as always, oppressed ppl can't win. A person of colour is never an expert on racism. Never. Doesn't matter that they, you know, live with the daily reality of racism and white supremacy. Doesn't matter if they've also spent four years studying critical race theory. Just doesn't matter.

What matters is that we know we are stupid because the opinion of some ignorant white teen on tumblr is carries more weight than anything we could possibly do.
