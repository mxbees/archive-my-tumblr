the thing that gets me about anons like that.

is that there are literally billions of self-involved (non-Black) asians out there who don't give a fuck about Black ppl.


me deciding that i don't want to be a self-involved piece of shit isn't holding anyone else back from doing whatever they want to do.

and i'm sorry that ur unable to actually see the connections between things and are just plain wrong about pretty much everything.
