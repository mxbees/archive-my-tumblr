oh. also? 

here's another form of widely supported racial eugenics:

poc in the third world (and first world too)

are constantly being told that there are too many of us and we are having too many babies and that we need to stop.

this whole 'overpopulation' thing is a widely supported form of eugenics by many white ppl. who often do not see a problem with it and will happily defend it.
