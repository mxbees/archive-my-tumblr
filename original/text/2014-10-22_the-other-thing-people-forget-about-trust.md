title: The other thing people forget about trust...

<p>It is fragile and easily broken.</p>&#13;
<p>If you break it, be prepared to spend at least as much time as it took for you to build it in the first place.</p>&#13;
<p>Be prepared not to get a second chance, because no one owes this to you.</p>&#13;
<p>Be warned that if you break trust, someone may need to protect themselves from you (which may include violence).</p>&#13;
<p>My advice? Don't break trust.</p>&#13;
<p>Treat it like the delicate, precious gift that it is. Always. </p>
