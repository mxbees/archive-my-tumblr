<p>like…

that is honestly one of the more upsetting responses i’ve seen to a post in a long long time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;what a fucking way to shit on an elder who’s given her entire life to the community&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;she fucking got knocked out at stonewall and has been fighting ever since

and you know?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;there are real reasons why a elder Black trans woman needs ongoing donations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;you think she has ever had enough money to save up for retirement?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;jesus fuck.</p>
