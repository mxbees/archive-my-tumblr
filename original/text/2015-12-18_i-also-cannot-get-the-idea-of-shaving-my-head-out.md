i also cannot get the idea of shaving my head out of my head.

i feel like this is a thing that must happen.

i could wear hats all the time again.

toques. hoodies. scarves.

of course my stealth stats would probably drop to like, -1.

maybe i'd have to go back to using the men's restroom in public?

idk. its all weird.
