title: holism as world view
---
I saw a recent something that was partially about worldviews (I'm not going to repeat what I saw because it appeared far too... simplistic and reductive to me, as far as the distinctions go). I can't remember the one they generally assigned to white people. 

Whatever, this isn't actually important. What I really want to discuss is the function of holism within my own worldview and the philosophy I write.

Holism, in the most simplistic sense, is a perspective of the world that sees all things as fundamentally connected, as part of a singular whole. Of course, it can get finer grained than this, such that parts of the whole can represents wholes of their own, with their on constituent parts and so on. Beyond the ontological[^ontology] claim that everything altogether creates a 'whole' in some non-trivial respect, it then also becomes an epistemology[^episteme].

The epistemological content of holism, like all other epistemologies, is heavily structured by the ontology. If everything is connected, then knowledge of those things is also connected. Another way of looking at this is that, to some extent, this is an epistemology that somewhat favours a system-level of analysis. Knowledge of individual parts of the whole can give generate knowledge about the whole. Knowledge of the whole helps you understand the parts. See? It's all connected.

Of course, once we start talking about knowledge, then we need to start talking about truth (eg, metaphysics). The theory of truth that slots easiest into this worldview is the [coherence theory of truth][coherence]. This theories, generally, states that the truth of a statement at least in part depends on its relationship to other statements. That this is a major factor in how I understand truth shouldn't be a surprise, given how I most often use 'incoherent' as a way to discredit theories or ideas. I don't often say 'you are wrong' or 'this is false', but rather that it is incoherent.

In general, people tend to associate 'holism' with ~Eastern~ religions/philosophies. As such, I've no doubt that most people reading this have at least a passing acquaintance with the worldview, since it tends to figure prominently in white appropriations of 'Asian' religions/intellectual traditions. 

Of course, as with all things, the reality is more complex than this. In part because 'Asian' covers a vast and varied set of intellectual traditions, each of which is just as complex as the white philosophical tradition. While holism is definitely not the most prominent worldview in white philosophy, it is one that has been articulated separately from appropriations of ~Eastern~ philosophy. And the opposite is true, of course. Not all ~Eastern~ philosophy is holistic. 

Anyway.

The point I'm making, overall, is that... now that I've mentioned it, it should be fairly apparent to most people the role that holism plays in my own philosophical writings. One of the things I'm constantly trying to articulate is the way that various (sometimes seemingly disconnected) ideas are related. 

Its why I never understand why other non-Black asians get so upset about how frequently I talk about anti-Blackness vs 'Asian' stuff. For me? It's all connected. Focusing and discussing and trying to figure out anti-Blackness, for me, *is* to focus on 'Asian' stuff. And I'm not just talking the fact that 'Black' and 'Asian' aren't mutually exclusive, but that even if they were, they'd *still* be connected. At least as far as I'm concerned.

One example for how/why taking a holistic approach can be massively useful can be seen from 'intersectionality', the theory created by Kimberle Crenshaw. One thing you can understand the theory as asserting is that Black women are whole people, such that their personhood cannot be reduced to a single part of their identity, each part of their identity works to create a unified whole that is something more than just the sum of the parts. As such, it is nonsensical to try and talk about the womanhood of a Black woman in isolation from her Blackness.

[^ontology]: Ontology is the part of philosophy that deals with what exists and how it exists.

[^episteme]: In case ppl don't know, 'epistemology' is the study of knowledge. As in what counts as knowledge, how knowledge is acquired, etc.
