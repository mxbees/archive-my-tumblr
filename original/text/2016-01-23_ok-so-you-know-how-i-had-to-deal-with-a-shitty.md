ok. so you know how i had to deal with a shitty customer service person with my credit card?

it looks like he froze my card.

bc despite answering all of his questions, the problem i was having was with the security question when logging in.

and he was like 'i can't solve this for you. we'll have to call u back in a few days.'

which apparently actually meant that he froze my card

despite this problem being about simply accessing my account info online.

he basically just fucked a bunch of stuff up for me

bc he's a transmisogynist

who thinks my voice sounds 'male'.
