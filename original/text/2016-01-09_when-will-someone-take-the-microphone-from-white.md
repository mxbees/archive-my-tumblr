When will someone take the microphone from white trans women? Like. Can you all just stfu and stop writing these shitty articles? Pls?

I mean. Really. 

"Then, Cindy ominously informed us that “Alex uses the pronoun 'they.'""

Could you get anymore pointlessly dramatic? And of course bc she's an old crusty white women she uses grammar as her justification for being a shithead.

> Because right now, this is what we transgender women need: Understanding and acceptance. We are a tiny minority in this country, and there are way too many people out there telling lies about us and trying to whip up hatred against us. So, we need to seize every possible opportunity to show the world that we (in most respects) are no different from anyone else (and can be trusted to use the ladies room).

> But if my “gender-fluid” and “gender non-conforming” compatriots are going to run around trying to impose unnatural, ungrammatical pronouns on the people they meet, we will never gain the acceptance we desire.

First of all, fuck you.

In case anyone is wondering she appears to be a pretty classic case of a True Transsexual(tm).

I could (maybe should) deconstruct her hysterical rant more. But. I kind of think it speaks for itself. I mean. Really.
