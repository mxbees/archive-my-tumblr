in keeping with my champion level of procrastination and avoidance

i literally spent the entire morning (and part of the afternoon)

configuring a new desktop environment for myself.

was this necessary? no.

was there about a million things i ought to have been doing? yes.

what did do? spend seven hours working on my config file. :D
