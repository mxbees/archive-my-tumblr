really not joking about love and relationships being easy. 

my relationship is probably the easiest thing in my life. 

it isn't perfect. not even close. it isn't just fluff and rainbows. 

but. 

it's easier than anything else I have going. and it's been the easiest thing in my life since it started. 

there's no angst. we don't have fights. we don't even argue. 

what we do have: is a lot of hugs,  affection, cuddles, conversations, kisses, and love.
