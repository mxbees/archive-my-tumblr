at some point, i should really write out a personal essay

about my own experiences. like. really get into them.

bc, as i learn more about myself, i see a lot of interesting differences in my own narrative than the mainstream ones.

like. to this day, i still have not 'come out' of the closet.

i honestly, finally understand that i don't have the faintest clue how ppl feel about being in one (if they are). its something, i think, that has made me somewhat less than compassionate on a few occassions.
