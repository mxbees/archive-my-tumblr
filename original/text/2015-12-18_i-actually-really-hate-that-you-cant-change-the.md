i actually really hate that you cant change the post type of posts anymore.

i want to reblog this thing that claims that (tw: csa)

csa victims 'often' go on to commit csa


but i don't want to subject ppl to the image without any warning

for the record

[intergenerational transmission of abuse is over-hyped](http://b.binaohan.org/posts/2015-08-29-on-intergenerational-abuse.html)

most victims of abuse (csa or otherwise) do **not** go on to become abusers.

and by 'most' i mean a large majority.

stop spreading this harmful myth. ur only hurting survivors and victims.
