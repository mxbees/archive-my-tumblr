*shakes fist at python*

bc i'm a loser, i decided to learn ruby instead of python.

and now i'm realizing that i really ought to have learned python.

for the sort of work i do, python would be soooo much more useful.

and then a lot of the scripts i'm currently using are python, not ruby.

and i can't edit them bc i don't know anything about python.

:(
