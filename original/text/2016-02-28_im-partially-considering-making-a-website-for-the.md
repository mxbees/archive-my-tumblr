i'm partially considering making a website for the 2nd edition of decolonizing trans/gender 101. 

like. still write the book. but... now that i'm recording some of the sections.

it'd be interesting to collect it all into one, centralized place....

like the videos. transcripts. actual chapters or sections. organized and basically viewable.

and then ppl could like, pay for downloads of the video and a full copy of the book.

but otherwise everything would be up there and freely accessible...
