I think its been about a week since I saw a curious tweet that appeared to be criticizing 'ideological purity' by contrasting it with the reality that many ppl need to make a living and survive. Beyond the... misunderstanding of why I've been talking about ideological purity[^vain], its really the personal implications that bother me.

(And by 'personal' I mean *me* not a generalized subject. But me. In specific.)

It grates on me because more than most people I know, I am intimately familiar with how demands to perform and embody purity can ruin your fucking life. Deeply familiar with how being pure is incompatible with survival and how demands for purity are demands for death/martyrdom.

I'm sitting here in the broken remains of my life after first doing what I think is right and then having to compromise in order to survive....

Just... being told that I'm wrong (or whatever) because people need to make a living in this life?

When I'm unemployable, still poor, and having to beg for money on a constant basis?

When I look at my future and realize that my options for survival are:

1. Hope that one day my bf can support me
2. Hope I can prove to the govt that I'm disabled enough to require support
3. Hope that I can maintain my precarious position as a writer can keep begging for money.
4. Hope that one of the food service jobs I've been applying for actually hires me so that I can start accumulating experience again in an industry where I might be able to have a future.
4. Hope that after I get my tits I might be marketable as a tranny sex worker

These are the most realistic ones. I'd love to say that I could go back to school, retrain, and maybe get another Career. But. It isn't going to happen. No matter where I try to go, people are going to google me. And when they google me, they'll toss out my application and that'll be that. The only industry that *might* not care is food service. McDonald's might not care about the lawsuit and my toxic reputation... then again, I haven't heard back from them about the application I submitted last week. So... we'll see, I guess.

Ideological purity (with a dosage of nomartive professionalism) destroyed my ability to make a living in this life.

But I'm just spouting jargon and empty words, right? I'm, what, trying to convince people that they should be pure and free of sin? That I don't care about people alive today staying alive, being safe, and maybe even more than that? 

Whatever. I might talk about these things, by and large, in an abstract, generalized fashion. It's how my brain works. But that doesn't change the fact that I'm speaking from my experiences. That this (and many other) issues aren't deeply personal for me.

In any case, I'll just go back to being an emotionless discourse robot.
