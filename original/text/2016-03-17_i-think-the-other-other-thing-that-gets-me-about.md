i think the other other thing that gets me about all of the neo-umbrellas

is that every single one that i've seen legitimizes the lie that Gay Inc told the world to push twoc out of the movement we started.

yesterday's attempt: nsa/nca (not straight alinged, not cis aligned or some such shit)

like. when will these ppl realize that gender and sexuality are not two distinct aspects of our being? that they are intimately entwined?

that the idea that they are different is a really recent invention????
