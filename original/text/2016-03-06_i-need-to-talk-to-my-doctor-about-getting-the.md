i need to talk to my doctor about getting the results from my sleep studies.

bc i'm pretty sure that the sleep specialist is just being an asshole about medication.

like. he was pretty clear that he would Not Medicate unless i had narcolepsy.

except based on everything i've read, my average sleep latency is enough to make me functionally so. like. i averaged about five minutes to fall asleep for each napping period. didn't hit REM sleep. but... the diagnostic test for narcolepsy in an average of eight minutes, with two occurrences of REM. idiopathy hypersomnia is a short average latency without the REM.

like i know my main treatment option should be CPAP. but. that fucking machine. is expensive and i hated using it.

ugh. whatever.
