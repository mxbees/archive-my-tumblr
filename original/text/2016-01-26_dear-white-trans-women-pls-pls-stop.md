dear white trans women,

pls, pls stop celebrating when a Black man gets a disproportionate sentence for transmisogynist violence. 

actually, pls stop celebrating when Black men (or any Black person) are incarcerated.

just. stop.

it is *not* a victory when hate crime laws, the current level of trans awareness, etc, is simply used as another excuse to incarcerate Black people. 

no one is winning here. this isn't justice for victims.

no love,

b.

ps. abolish prisons

pps. i hate u all
