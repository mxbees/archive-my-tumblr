title: Only 30% of homeless shelters willing to house trans women with women
---
They called 100 shelters in 4 states to see what kind of access trans women in these states had to homeless shelters.

Overall, only 30% would house trans women in gender appropriate facilities (ie, as women).

21% outright refused shelter.

This? Is why the public accommodations debate is so fucking important. Yes. Peeing and shitting matters a great deal. But trans women have been and will continue to use public restrooms when we must. 

Homeless shelters, women's shelters, rape crisis centres, etc, however? Are an entirely different story. 

I'd love to see someone do a test like this with IPV/DV Women's shelters and/or rape crisis ones. Having some actual figures and facts about trans women's access to these spaces (rather than just - albeit important - anecdotes).
