title: how to use paypal without exposing your legal name
---
Paypal is a tricky service bc its the most used online payment thing. But... bc they usually will make you connect it to a credit card, bank account, or otherwise verify your legal identity, it can be risky.

Paypal also finally released a service where you can have a custom URL to direct people to for donations. Mine is [http://paypal.me/nmx](http://paypal.me/nmx). I was irritated at this, though, because it displays your full legal name without any way to make it private. But if you clicked my link you'll notice that it shows my pen-name, not my legal name.

Here's the steps:

1. Convert your paypal account from a personal one to a business one.
2. You can make your 'business' name a pseud or anything.
3. Setup your paypal.me account.

That's really it. I originally converted to a business account bc I'm [selling my writing](http://by.mxb.ca) and if you sell stuff, you need a business account. 

If you donate money directly by email and whenever people send you money, they'll see your 'business' name, not your personal/legal name.
