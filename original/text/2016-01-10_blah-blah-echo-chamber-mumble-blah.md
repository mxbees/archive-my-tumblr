Oh, Medium. The place where people get to publish blog posts that get the sheen of Authority bc [of country clubs on the web][club]. Today I got to read [Yet Another Thinkpiece on how The Internet and Social Media is an Echo Chamber Threatening Democracy][echo]. As always, there is finger wagging at social media and how the current situation is Somehow Worse than it ever was before:

> But this holier-than-thou social media behavior is counterproductive, it’s self-aggrandizement at the cost of actual nuanced discourse and if we want to consider online discourse productive, we need to move past this...What is emerging is the worst kind of echo chamber, one where those inside are increasingly convinced that everyone shares their world view, that their ranks are growing when they aren’t.

B O R I N G

And, sure, I've no doubt buddy who wrote this will take this as another example to prove his point. I'm okay with this. But since I've made it one of my own Things to constantly point out [how the 'filter bubble' is a privileged notion][bubble], I'll take some time to address some of the points in this blog post.

The crux of his argument is thusly:

> When someone communicates that they are not “on our side” our first reaction is to run away or dismiss them as stupid. To be sure, there are hateful, racist, people not worthy of the small amount of electricity it takes just one of your synapses to fire. I’m instead referencing those who actually believe in an opposing viewpoint of a complicated issue, and do so for genuine, considered reasons. Or at least, for reasons just as good as yours.

Before I get into the meat of this, it is kind of interesting how my point is already proved within his own words. Why, exactly, is 'hateful, racist' somehow contrast with people who have 'genuine reasons maybe as good as yours" for believing in the opposing viewpoint? An interesting contrast given how [scientific racism is actually re-entering mainstream thought][science] (to the extent that it can be said to have actually left in the first place).

Those hateful, racists apparently not worth my/your time? Are actual people who fucking hate me. Easy enough for this br0 to dismiss but, um, this is my fucking life. Hateful racists, regardless of how carefully considered or seemingly rational their reason for hating me, have a constant, direct, and negative impact on my life. 

This was part of the main point I was making in my [old filter bubble post][bubble]. These opposing viewpoints that technology and my life are supposedly filtering out? Are constant impositions that I *cannot* ignore because they represent barriers and obstacles to overcome. Unlike Sean Blanda, I do not have the luxury of just waving away and dismissing 'hateful racists' and trying to perform his brand of empathy by really trying to understand their reasons for hating me and everyone like me[^lol].

As is wont with privileged people, he is making a virtue out of something that is much, much easier for anyone privileged to do. Notice how this all about 'points' and 'opinions' as if these themselves are value neutral entities. They aren't. As if someone else's opinion (and sitting down to 'listen' to it) is something without harm or danger.

I am one of the people who actively seeks out 'opinions' that 'disagree' with my own. I read articles on the federalist. I read news articles, blog posts, journal articles, books, etc, all of which I don't agree with and that don't agree with me. But I do this with the understanding that engaging garbage like that has a real and perceptable emotional and psychological cost. My research on the history of scientific racism keeps sputtering out as I need to take breaks between reading the foundational, primary sources that constructed a system responsible for the deaths and oppression of millions and billions of people. It's also very much not something I'd be capable of or willing to do in real time.

But I do this because I want to. I don't think it necessarily makes me a better person than the people I know who don't want to (or can't) engage the filth I regularly encounter. The people I know online tend to exist in 'echo chambers' bc these ephemeral, digital spaces are some of the very few where they have enough agency and control that they can make some breathing room between them and all the 'disagreeing opinions'[^notreally].

One of the things I'm perhaps best known for is my outright refusal to engage in any discussion or debate about my humanity. As noted above, I do seek out stuff that gives me all the well considered reasons why some don't think I'm human. But I outright refuse to engage this singular point with any given individual in real time. Or even when researching. Balta asks us to consider the reality that 'we're not right about everything'. Sure. I know I'm not. However, on this one point? I am right and everyone else is wrong. 

I am human. End of story.

The thing with most of the views that oppose my own, is that pretty much all of them share the one basic premise (which is foundational to all of their arguments) that I am, in fact, Not Human. At one point, he mentions debate club. Which whatever. I never did that. I did, however, spend many years studying logic. Within logic, one of the key goals is to study forms of arguments in which true premises can never lead to false conclusions. And the reverse ends up being true as well: arguments with false premises are always invalid, regardless of whether or not the conclusion is true. As such, I don't see the point of trying to consider 'opposing opinions' in which a major premise is that I am Not Human as being potentially true (and, thus, that I might be wrong). My humanity is not a 'fact' or 'opinion' subject to debate. And no amount of smug, privileged liberalism will change my mind about this.

Let me, however, use a current example of what I mean by this (for any new readers). At this moment, one of the most divisive and proliferating human right's/discrimination issues is.... Trans women using public restrooms, changerooms, and other accommodations. [Houston was recently a major site of this conflict][hero]. The [HRC raised and spent about 4 million dollars only to loose by a wide margin][losers]. What was the main slogan used to defeat HERO? 

No men in women's bathrooms.

Sure, sure, there were many conclusions about why such a thing would be dangerous and undesirable, but this was the basic point. It was repeated over and over again and it is, more or less, the main premise upon which many current opposition to trans women getting equal access to public accommodations. You know. One of the human rights things.

In order to have any kind of meaningful 'debate', I and these people need some sort of common ground. But it simply isn't possible when we can't even agree on the foundational facts. I think trans women are women, they do not. All of our arguments on either side of the debate depend on that one premise. There literally is *no possible way* to have a sincere, reasoned discussion about this.

(FYI: A discussion about trans women's womanhood is also a discussion about our humanity. Because, you know, human rights and all that.)

The only way we could productively engage one another is if one of us is willing to, at least momentarily, accept the other's position. Thus, if I want to do the sort of thing that Blanda claims is 'necessary for my progress as an individual', my only choice is to sincerely entertain the notion that I am not human. Or for my the Other Side to sincerely entertain the notion that I am human. Blanda appears to think that both sides should make this good faith effort, otherwise you might be 'worse' than the Other Side, lmao. As if both of these positions are equivalent in some non-trivial way.

What he is suggesting in this blog post is nice and all, if it weren't my actual life and freedom at stake, rather than some 'fun game' he and his friends like to play. This is my life, not a game. My life and not a debate club.

My humanity is not up for discussion.

[^lol]: Amusingly, I can only smile at his final conclusion, "Because refusing to truly understand those who disagree with you is intellectual laziness and worse, is usually worse than what you’re accusing the Other Side of doing". Lmao. So... when I call someone a white supremacist and refuse to entertain their proposition that I'm not human, I'm possibly worse than them? Hahahaha. Ok. Sure.

[^notreally]: And this is also very much an incredibly fragile thing, since these 'differences in opinion' always manage to find us and make sure that we don't forget that they exist.
