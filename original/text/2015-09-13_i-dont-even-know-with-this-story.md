title: i don't even know with this story
---
> She, literally, wants what every other girl is allowed to do – use the bathroom, comfortably.

> Unfortunately, this story isn’t black and white.

> It has the potential to go way right or far left.

> That is just how life is.

> Someone will always end up with the short end of the stick.

> Perry, is only asking for the respect and privacy the other girls and boys.

> So, how does one decide who deserves it more?

> Choose Perry, you’re disrespecting the “non-trans” girls’ right to privacy, but choose against her, you’re being discriminatory.

In case anyone is wondering, this is a classic example of a false dilemma. Moreover, while the writer appears to be making a salient point about the very real problem of competing rights, its disingenuous because that dynamic doesn't actually apply to this situation. 

Earlier the writer says this:

> So, if our forefathers can free our nation from tyranny, rid the country of slavery and put an end to segregation of races. Why is that we can’t rid the nation of social discrimination?

> Individuals’ stories are never one in the same.

> They are just that, individuals.

Disregarding the flagrant lie that is the first sentence, the latter one demonstrates exactly where the error lies.

The point is, is that this isn't about 'individuals'. And this person knows that because they are explicitely talking about _classes_ of people not just individuals. Or rather, they name a singular trans girl and stack her against 'the non-trans girls'. 

While I'm not super keen on our current system of government, this person is acting like there has never been a case of competing rights between two groups. One of which is dominant and the other a marginalized class. Like how in an ideally functioning democracy, maintaining the rights of the marginalized class takes priority. 

Example: that clerk who keeps refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. Yes. She has a right to her religion and this competes with the gay couples right to equal treatment under the law. And now that the US has finally stopped blocking this equal treatment, which does the law favour? The marginalized group.

In reality, this situation isn't actually that difficult. Whatever perceived right to privacy that cis ppl feel entitled too, doesn't actually override trans people's right to equal access to public accommodations.

> Let’s not steer away from the matter at hand: No life is greater than the other.

> We walk, talk and breathe just the same.

> Our beliefs and personalities may be different, but that’s the beauty of the world, different cultures, people and beliefs coming together and learning from each other.

> There may be no right or wrong, in the story of Lila Perry.

See? All of this sounds reasonable and balanced until you think about the power disparities. This is only reasonable in a context where all parties are otherwise equal. Then we'd have a real dilemma. 

But in this case? There is no ethical dilemma. At all.
