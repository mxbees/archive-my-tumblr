i don't think i'll ever stop being amused about the fact that i'll listen to a story and be like

"who the fuck falls in love over a weekend? this is so unbelievable"

only to remember like five seconds after that

me.

i am the type of person who falls in love over a weekend.

this happened to me.

i did this.

and jumped into a relationship within a week of meeting my bf.

(although, to be fair, i still kind of find it unbelievable)
