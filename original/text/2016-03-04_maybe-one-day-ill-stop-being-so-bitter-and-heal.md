maybe one day. i'll stop being so bitter and heal over the wounds i have from my experiences in the gay community.

maybe i'll express my thoughts and feelings about how some trans women use it

maybe i'll say something about how so many are committed to fucking as praxis.

but i'm honestly fucking tired of these discussions.

like. i *could* spend time talking about exclusionary practices, ideological purity, fucking as praxis, and other shitty community dynamics

don't see the point though.

i got the message loud and clear: girls like me have no place.

better yet... based on shit i've seen and observed

even if i did have a place, i'd still stay far far away.
