title: we are more than tools to improve the bottom line

##Intro

Two years ago I wrote a blog post about [why I don't like economic arguments for human rights -- in this case diversity][1]. I still hold the same view (and I think I've written about it since). So I wasn't happy to see a recent article about how [diverse faculties make for better, more creative research][2] or some such nonsense:

> Ending this underrepresentation is important for many reasons, not least because of the unquestionable importance of fairness and equity. But it turns out that diversity also makes good economic sense.

> Research by my colleagues and I suggests that university administrators who do not work hard to attract and retain African-American faculty may well be missing out on an important benefit: Academic departments that are more diverse may produce more unorthodox ideas and do more original work. In the academic world, where there is a big premium on being the first to come up with an idea, this is a major benefit.

There are a number of assumptions that we can unpack here about how oppression works and why economics is one of the worst fields (although, I'll admit I'm somewhat biased in my loathing of economics as a whole).

##why does this matter?

Above all, I don't think I've seen many explanations from proponents of the economic argument for human rights as to why they actually think that the bottom line has any relevance to the issue. Sure, sure, we could take the second paragraph as providing the motivation for why economics has anything to do with diversity. But it isn't actually a real explanation.

Note the language used, 'fairness and equity.' This sounds nice but, by and large, isn't the goal of most liberatory movements and social justice minded people I know. Fundamentally, this writer entirely misunderstands the social and political context for why faculties aren't more diverse. While the last sentence of the article suggests a minor awareness of it -- "stop hiring people who look like you" -- its also far too passive for what is actually happening.

Nowadays, we like to attribute things like a lack of diversity as a result of implicit or unconscious bias. And, sure, this is a part of it. But this is all to individual. What is being ellided here is the fact that the lack of diversity is a product of the very institutions and context in which we work and do hiring. This isn't just about one or two hiring commmittees unconsciously selecting candidates that are like them. Nor is it a mustache twirling conspiracy.

In any case, the problem with this assumption is that the end goal of 'diversity' is fairness and equity. Which might be true of some people but I know that, for myself (and all other oppressed people), what I want is **freedom**.

Indeed, I'd like to do away with the entire economy in which people can coherently mark arguments that diversity is good for the bottom line.

##what is the purpose of a university?

The other assumption that really made me laugh is in the last sentence of the quote above, "In the academic world, where there is a big premium on being the first to come up with an idea". I just...

Having been a graduate student, here is my overall impression about the desire for 'original' research within the academy: its a big fucking lie.

I'm not quite disputing the notion that the academy cares about claiming first rights to a 'discovery' but rather that their interest in this is with in prescribed and narrow boundaries. That 'originality' in research is desirable so long as it fits within certain pre-determined criteria. Criteria that are often implicitly embedded within the institution itself and that preclude the inclusion of diverse people to begin with.

The amusing thing is that most people entrenched within academia generally fail to see this. The academy is no more interested in a diversity of ideas than it is for people. And the ways this operates is on many levels, some of which are quite subtle and basically invisible until you smash your career against the barrier.

Consider the following situation:

There is an English major applying for PhD programs (I'm in Canada so I'm operating with the assumption that this student already has an MA and is current in the scholarship of their intended field). And they are a good student, one who is an ideal, rational agent as far as economic models are concerned. So they are doing diligent research into the job market, projections, current situation, all the relevant details that will shape their PhD experience and future career as an academic. One of the things they read is [this article about who gets faculty jobs in English][3], they see that 

> students in top-10 programs might have a reasonable chance of getting tenure-track jobs at a national research university or national research liberal arts colleges, the chances for such placements are essentially nil for students graduating from lower ranked programs.

Being a rational person, this student realizes that the only way to have a decent chance of success is to be accepted at a top-10 program, otherwise choosing to do a PhD in English is a waste of time and money. Doing an honest assessment of their grades and qualifications, they feel like they have a chance at being accepted. A high enough chance that they are willing to spend around $100 per application. And, again, being rational, they understand that they'll maximize their chances if they apply at all top-10 schools. So this will cost at least $1000 (very likely more).

As with most scholars, they are very passionate about the topic they'd like to research. And, as it turns out, their research actually and really does present an interesting, novel approach. Truly original research. However, as they look over the English faculty at each institution, they start to realize that essentially no faculty member would likely be a suitable supervisor (they don't study the same time period, type of literature, and/or use the same theoretical approach). There are some who are tangential to what the student wishes to research but no really good fits.

Somewhat despondent, the student decides to check some other schools. Already being familiar, the student already sort of knows that there aren't actually very many people who are interested in this particular niche and theoretical approach. Their masters thesis really relied on piecing together fragments from a diverse group of scholars. This is, in fact, why their research is truly original.

The student decides to go ahead and apply, hoping that someone will see the value in their research (because it is demonstrably original) even though it isn't their specialization. As late winter and early spring come about, they start receiving rejection after rejection. The most common and prominent reason given for the rejection is the lack of adequate supervision.

So ends their academic career because they are rational and understand that given the circumstances, they either need to change their topic to something they aren't really interested in or move on to something else. The elect to move on. And the world keeps spinning.

An institution that truly functioned to encourage, support, and foster original research, one that actually valued it, such a situation wouldn't be so easy to imagine. Nor would it actually happen in the real world (and, yes, the above has happened give or take a few details). And look, I did the above without any reference to the person's socio-economic background. No idea what gender they are, what race, class, ability, etc. All we know is that they are a good student with a demonstrably original research plan.

I went into this at length because this is one of the more subtle ways that the university structure precludes or excludes what it claims to value. The supervision issue within academia enforces a certain level of conformity, so that all students who wish to advance need to narrow their research interests in order to find 'adequate' supervision. This isn't about originality. This isn't an environment where it'll grow and be supported.

##why the economic argument might actually work...

Given the above, it might seem strange for me to assert that an economic argument for diversity might be more effective than anything else (supposing that institutions don't value oppression more than money -- which isn't something we should take as a given btw). But if university's aren't about research or originality, particularly in the current context, what are they about?

Well. You don't have to look far to find critiques of the neo-liberalization of universities and how many of them are adopting business models. Models wherein the bottom line is actually of great importance. Potentially more important than higher ed's need to remain an elite institution available to mostly privileged citizens (or high paying international students).

So perhaps, at long last, the academy is actually in a position where it'll value money and profit more than elitism and social/economic exclusion.
