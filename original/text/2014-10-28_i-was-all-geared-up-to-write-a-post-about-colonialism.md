title: I was all geared up to write a postâ€¦ about colonialism and gender and stuff.

<p>But. I tried. And then failed. In part because my bf kept interrupting me but also because I was annoyed with him. Also, they cleaned the halls of my building with something strong that is making me sneeze, so I&#8217;m feeling super drowsy from anti-histamines. Blech.</p>
<p>The post was going to be about:</p>
<ul>
<li>R*dfems and their inherent white supremacy</li>
<li>Because of their position on trans stuff and they ways they support/enforce the binary</li>
<li>And since the binary is a colonial tool</li>
<li>this means that r*dfems are colonialist</li>
<li>and colonialism also an expression of white supremacy,</li>
<li>therefore, r*dfems are colonialists and white supremacists.</li>
<li>and will always be</li>
<li>because the very foundations of their analysis and &#8216;radical&#8217; approach</li>
<li>depends on reifying a tool of white supremacy</li>
<li>and you can never win so long as your approach simply creates what you wish to destroy.</li>
<li>those feminists who are not radical but neither challenge radicalism nor include intersectionality in a meaningul way</li>
<li>are exactly the same</li>
<li>and this is, in part, why I still don&#8217;t have time for trans feminism</li>
<li>because I have no desire to associated with hate mongering white supremacists and the people that complacently go along with it</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t need feminism</li>
<li>I need decolonization</li>
</ul>
<p>That is the post I wanted to write&#8230;</p>
<p>instead I have a post that doesn&#8217;t make any sense and I&#8217;m still not sure what the hell I&#8217;m talking about.</p>
