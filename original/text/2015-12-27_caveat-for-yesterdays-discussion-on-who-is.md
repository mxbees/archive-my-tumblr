title: caveat for yesterday's discussion on 'who is straight'
---
I posted [an essay yesterday about fucking as praxis and gender-sexuality][fucking]. One of the sections is a discussion about 'who is straight'. After seeing a post on tumblr today (not a reaction to my essay, something unrelated), I feel like I need to.... qualify this discussion so that ppl are clear about 'straight' as identity.

In the section, I'm basically addressing the complicated relationship between gender and sexuality. Which, has always been within my own philosophy, one and the same. These are not distinct 'identities'. However, most of our current discourse treats it as such.

The post I saw today had this statement: "you're only straight if you identify that way".

This is a false statement.

If this statement were true, there would be significantly fewer straight people than actually exist. Indeed, there probably wouldn't be enough straight people to actually oppress the rest of us.

Why? Because it is only a small minority of straight people who identify that way. Being straight is thedefault sexuality, thus many people who are straight never have reason to overtly or explicitly identify themselves as straight. Indeed, many don't even really bother think about their sexuality at all, much less going through the effort of identifying it. They are what is normal and default. They are who get to exist as unmarked.

The same applies to any oppressor class. It isn't an _identity_, its a class. Being part of the oppressor class does not require self-identification. Indeed, self-identification as an oppressor is irrelevant and meaningless. Instead, it is the _opressed_ who name our oppressors. We decide, not you. Your denials and protests do nothing to change the dynamics of power and oppression that are instituationally enforced.

Again, this is the major failing of white identity politics. That you are only who you say you are. Which to me, is super fascinating, because this is literally a type of agency that is only accorded to the most privileged and those with the most power. And thinking that you're only an oppressor if you identify that way says a lot about your relative privilege and power.

Oppressed people don't get to 'chose' whether or not we 'identify' as an oppressed class. I literally have zero say in being Asian. I am Asian because white ppl say I am. My people were once Malay because white people said we were. We were also Indians because white people. Whatever race I am is wholly determined by white people. I have no choice.

But there are lots of white people who don't identify as 'white'. They get this choice. And indeed, I've seen quite a few explicitely *not* identify as white as a way to dodge responsibility and culpability fo their role in white supremacy. Happens all the time. The irish and italians and spaniards fucking *love* this trick.

Anyway. Fuck white identity politics. Ur wrong.
