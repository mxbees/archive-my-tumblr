<p>and, unsurprisingly it is often these white ethnics who want to complain about</p>

<p>how the social construct of &#8216;race&#8217; has erased their individual identities</p>

<p>even though this is literally true of <em>every</em> single race</p>

<p>that is the whole point of race</p>

<p>and YET</p>

<p>interesting how these ethnic whites <em>still</em> get better recognition for their unique</p>

<p>ethnicities over and above any poc ethnicity i know</p>

<p>almost like they are white&#8230; and thus get the benefit of being seen as unique/individual</p>
