<p>also, the way my current blog is set up, now that this one isn&#8217;t my primary, i miss out on a lot of comments bc i forget to check my notifications.</p>

<p>which is still a feature, bc it finally broke my obsessive need to check <em>all</em> the time. which was definitely not good for my mental health.</p>
