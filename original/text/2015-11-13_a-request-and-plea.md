Based on what happened earlier this week, there's something I'd like to ask anyone who enjoys my writing, who thinks I matter, who is a fan, whatever:

**Please do not defend me.**

If you see anyone, anyone at all, saying negative, critical, whatever things about me, **please do not defend me**.

Instead, I'd like you to reflect on the claims, decide for yourself whether or not you believe them, and then move on. Use your own judgement, follow your intuitions, and make a decision.

People have a right to say and think whatever they want about me. And, who knows? They might actually be right and/or telling the truth.

I am not a perfect person. I do not require defending.

And this applies to *anything* anyone says about me. This includes claims of abuse, rape, violence, oppression, *anything*. I really mean this.

One of the things I believe in with utter certainty is that victims ought to be believed. This conviction does not change when I'm cast as the perpetrator. Believe anyone who says they've been victimized or hurt by me. Believe them.

If you have doubts. If you look at their claim and don't find it credible. Fine. But do not engage the person to try and defend me or prove them wrong. Use your own judgement, follow your intuitions, and make a decision. And then move on.

Please, I'm begging you, **do not defend me**.
