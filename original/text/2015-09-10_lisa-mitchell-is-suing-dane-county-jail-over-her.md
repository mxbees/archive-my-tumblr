title: Lisa Mitchell is Suing Dane County Jail over her treatment
---
**I'll be posting direct quotes from Lisa Mitchell and they might be triggering for some people - TW: Rape, incarceration, abuse**

> In a cramped visitation booth at the Dane County Jail, Lisa Mitchell sweeps her long narrow braids aside to reveal the bald spot where a man struck her with a glass bottle 17 years ago. She pulls up her regulation light blue jail shirt to uncover the jagged scar in her side where he then stabbed her with the remaining piece of bottle.

> “I just want to show you what he did,” she said, recalling the 1998 incident, deemed a hate crime. “When I looked down I could actually see the white flesh in my stomach.”

> As a transgender, black, 35-year-old woman, Mitchell has lived through a hate crime, sexual assaults, poverty and discrimination. She has been in and out of jail and prison for years, mostly for theft, most recently on charges of theft and battery, or what she calls a “prostitution gone bad.”

> “What happened to me is done,” Mitchell said. “I just feel like I see a lot of transgender expressed girls on the street now and fate may bring them through the doors of this place. And if I can hopefully change something where they don’t have to go through what I went through, that’s my biggest goal.”

> “I was born biologically male, but in my soul, in my spirit, I always felt like a woman,” Mitchell said. “So anything that they tried to impose on me that was boyish, I didn’t like.”

> “They have a saying in Chicago: There’s no children there,” Mitchell said. “And what it means is kids are forced to be adults, mentally, because of the environment. When I was younger we found dead bodies. I found a lady raped behind a door in the building hallway, she was crying. And, you know, I was only 8 years old.”

> When she was 12 or 13, Mitchell herself was raped. Three of her cousin’s friends saw her walking along a bike path and stopped her to ask her whether she was a girl or a boy.

> “I’m like, ‘Why? Why does it matter?’” Mitchell said.

> She said two of them held her down while one pulled down her pants.

> “They seen that I was biologically male and they did not care. He still penetrated me, he didn’t care,” Mitchell said. “I dealt with that too. And I didn’t tell nobody ‘til I got grown.”

> “I’ve been shoplifting all my life, just ‘cause I like to get clothes and food and stuff. Cause my mama was on drugs — she did heroin and crack — we didn’t get no clothes or anything. All the money went to the drug dealers, so we had to survive on our own,” Mitchell said.

> “I mean, that’s not no excuse, that’s just the route I took and I had to pay my dues to society for it, but I’m just letting you know some of the reasons why.”

> Mitchell claimed the male homeless shelter was “unsafe” and “unstable.” While there, she said, there was a night when she woke up to a man lying next to her who had unbuttoned her pants and was touching her.

> “Girl, when I woke up and see his face, you know how men, when they’re in that lust mode, they have the most freakiest look on their face. Girl, when I looked at his face it scared the shit out of me because it was like an evil look,” Mitchell said.

> At 35, she said, she needs to be done stealing, done walking into that jail. But whether she does end up back behind bars or not, she wants to keep fighting to change the system — for her transgender friend who tried to hang herself from a shower pole while in jail, for a transgender 23-year-old who is suing for hormonal therapy in the Eastern District or for whoever else walks through those doors.

> “They wanted this to be quiet. I don’t think this should be quiet,” Mitchell said. “I think this is something that should be brought to the surface.”

**This is a pretty long story and I mainly cut out the direct quotations from Mitchell, since it is so rare to see one of these articles that lets incarcerated Black trans women speak for themselves.**
