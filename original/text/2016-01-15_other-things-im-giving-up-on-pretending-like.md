other things i'm giving up on:

pretending like clothing tags don't bother me as much as they do.

those tops i bought for /piece are not only unflattering

but they have these tags...

i cut them off, but the remainder still irritates me *all fucking day*

so. 

i'm wearing them inside out from now on. did it today and the top was about a MILLION times more cozy.

so now i'm going to work in sunglasses, a hoodie, and inside out clothing...

lol.
