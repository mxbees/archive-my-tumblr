<p>i&#8217;m well and truly not joking when i say that the response i&#8217;m seeing to Leelah&#8217;s death is making me feel crazy</p>

<p>like.</p>

<p>i
m</p>

<p>depressed. i struggle with other mental illness. i&#8217;ve been abused.</p>

<p>this feels like some kind of&#8230; mass gaslighting bc barely anyone is seeing things that i&#8217;m seeing</p>

<p>(except for the few. and u know who u are)</p>

<p>like.</p>

<p>is this all real?</p>

<p>i hope when i wake up tomorrow the world makes a little more sense.</p>

<p>bc. fuck.</p>

<p>is this ever not a world i want to be living in myself.</p>
