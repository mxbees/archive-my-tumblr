i think the most fun thing about me trying to make writing a part time job

is that i've trapped myself in the student mindset again.

i feel guilty and bad if i'm not producing *something* all the time.

like. that i should be putting out at least one substantive post everyday.

but...

that'd probably be impossible. and lower the overall quality of what i produce.
