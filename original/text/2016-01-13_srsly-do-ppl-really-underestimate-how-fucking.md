srsly? do ppl really underestimate how fucking difficult it is to get employed as a twoc? and i'm not even Black like fuckrashida (in fact very light skinned).

you know what i have?

three degrees. one bachelors. one masters and another masters (but a professional degree, not research). 

i have experience bc i managed to get a single PT job in my field. i've been looking for full time work for *four* years since graduating.

my last application was to a job that literally has the *exact* same job title as i currently have. with the same fucking duties. just... full time. 

they didn't even call me.

i've spent four years following all the advice. i've been going to conferences. i even published my first peer reviewed article. just before i quit all uncompensated labour, i was starting to get invited to do keynote speeches. 

but no one will give me a fucking full time job.
