but seeing this convo with a radfem and demanding access to someone's volunteer accessibility blog. as if that isn't the very height of male entitlement. 

like. it isn't a public service or building or business. ur not fucking entitled to the labour of strangers on the internet. 

why do you have to be so male socialized?
