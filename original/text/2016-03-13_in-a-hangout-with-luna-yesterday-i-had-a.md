in a hangout with luna yesterday, i had a hypothesis.

since i don't like necessarily thinking that ppl are directly plagiarizing me (no reason why pple can't, as i did, think up these things on their own)

some of the ideas that i've been sitting on for the past year or so, i'm just not going to write about. these are ideas that i haven't shared bc i don't feel like getting harassed over them. 

but... we'll see if anyone else starts talking about them in a couple of years. then i'll know.

(although, in another way, this kind of makes me sad. bc i could -- as i already have -- make some contributions to various discourses. but the state of things today guarantees that i'd get harassed for saying some of the things i'm thinking. you know, like i used to (and, tbh, still do). i guess a large part of me is still exhausted and burned out from actively engaging that sort of thing.)
