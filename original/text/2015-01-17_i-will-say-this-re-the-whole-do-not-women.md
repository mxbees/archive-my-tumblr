i will say this

re: the whole 'do not-women' experience misogyny

while (most) ppl can admit that men do not experience misogyny

there is some question as to whether non-women experience it...

and.

tbh. i don't really care?

re: names for the experiences of ppl who are non-women (and presumably afab) and their possible experiences just isn't a priority for me.
