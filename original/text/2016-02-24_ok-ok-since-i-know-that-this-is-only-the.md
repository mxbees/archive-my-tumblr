ok. ok. since i know that this is only the beginning and ppl have also questioned why i'm friends with girljanitor. 

i'm going to state one more time: i'm not going to apologize or explain or whatever for being friends with the people i'm friends with.

do what you need to feel safe. to protect yourself. block me. unfollow. write a callout post. i don't care. take care of yourself.

but... do ppl not get what i mean when i say that my reputation is ruined?

look. this is the sort of thing ppl say about me now:

> They have apologized and admitted that they were lying but not until after a sustained and damaging campaign of online bullying and harassment. 

this is about *me*. if ur looking for someone ideologically pure. a saint. or whatever. i'm the wrong person.

it takes very little effort to find out, now that i've shared my name, all the reasons why i'm Problematic. and how i hurt Feminism. and how i'm a lying tranny bitch who bullies and harasses ppl online.

i'm a sinner. do what u want with this information. i don't care anymore.
