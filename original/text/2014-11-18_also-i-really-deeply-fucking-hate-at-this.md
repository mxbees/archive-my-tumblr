<p>also&#8230;</p>

<p>i really deeply fucking <em>hate</em> at this point</p>

<p>the way that a lot of ~progressive~ news related info type posts</p>

<p>on tumblr will</p>

<p>with zero TW or other indication</p>

<p>just list the graphic details of the murder of a marginalized person</p>

<p>(the one i&#8217;m seeing is about Tanesha Anderson&#8230;)</p>

<p>while this is something i see most often (because of what i read)</p>

<p>on stories about twoc who&#8217;ve been murdered</p>

<p>this is just as bad whenever it is the murder of any black person</p>

<p>(not just Black trans women, is what i&#8217;m saying)</p>

<p>WHY ARE YOU POSTING THE GRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS OF PEOPLE&#8217;S MURDERS WITHOUT A WARNING?</p>

<p>why do u need to include one <em>at all</em>?</p>

<p>the fact that the police have just killed another Black woman should be enough to feed any outrage or disgust or horror that you might feel about this.</p>

<p>i read a lot of news about trans women</p>

<p>and i swear, every single time i have to read about a twoc&#8217;s death</p>

<p>it is literally with graphic, sensationalist descriptions</p>

<p>i expect this stuff from regular media&#8230;</p>

<p>but if ur posting a link on tumblr</p>

<p>why is it so difficult to put a TW on your story?</p>

<p>or just leave out the graphic description???</p>
