oh. and one of the other major reason i know i vagueblog these days

is that the state of the Discourse in the interwebs

is such that ppl often take criticism as some kind of moral judgement about their character as a person.

and if not them, then other people will jump in with this kind of attitude

and then it blossoms into a Thing.

usually, i just want to talk about the idea/content of a post

*without* making it about the person who posted or reblogged it.

without possibly exposing them to harassment (bc, yeah, this has happened before)
