hey. i'm planning on spending a portion of my day tomorrow transcribing a bunch of the image posts that contain text (for accessibility).

if you have a specific post you'd like me to transcribe, reblog or reply to this post with the URL/link

and i'll do my best to do them all. 

important thing: this is for posts related to ferguson only (related stuff re: police violence against Black people is fine. so too is anything related to anti-Blackness. but only this stuff. i won't do anything else)
