something riley said on twitter yesterday or today made me have an epiphany:

i don't want to run a company/start up/whatever the fuck.

they were talking about how they don't want to create a startup just so that they can get their tech stuff funded.

lately... i've been looking into making biyuti publishing a 'not-for-profit' corporation. with the notion of trying to get it designated as a charity (this way we'd have a clear ability to do fundraising and it'd be pretty clear that it isn't about making profits and exploiting ppl).

i've also been talking off and on about how difficult it is to make a business plan/model in this context that doesn't exploit *someone*.

but.

i just don't want to do this. yes. i think its important. yes. i also suspect that i can't actually do this and maintain a certain level of health.

but more importantly. i just don't want to do it.

i don't want to run a company. for profit or not. charity or not.

it isn't what i want from my life. not what i want to do. i don't what the stress and anxiety.

do. not. want.
