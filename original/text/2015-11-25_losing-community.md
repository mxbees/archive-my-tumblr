I log into tumblr and see that one of my favourite ppl is talking about how alienated and isolate she feels from teh trans ~community~.

scroll through my twitter feed and see another twoc i admire and respect how she's been systematically cut off from teh trans ~community~.

back in february i make a blog post stating that i'm walking away from teh ~community~.

last spring/summer a schism happens in twoc tumblr as a bunch of ppl i also like and respect break free from some abusive shitheads who were 'prominent' within their respective circles (still might be for all i know).

last winter i got to see a bunch of twoc continue a multi year bullying and distortion campaign (i don't blame them, exactly, but it left an impression).

after four years of poking around online i've seen one vulnerable twoc after another get destroyed by teh ~community~ of our supposed peers.

so many of my favourite ppl have either: self-exiled themselves, been entirely bullied and pushed out, our simply policed out of even participating in the first place.

note: i'm only talking about twoc. and about twoc interacting with other twoc.

idk how to feel when most of the 'leaders' or ppl i see being celebrated look scarily like me (very lightskinned, mixed-with-white woc, never done sex work, and with some level of higher education).

anyway. it all breaks my heart. in another way, i think this level of disillusionment is pretty much what happened to me in the white cisgay community. except it hurts worse bc maybe i was actually supposed to fit in here.

when i saw that stat (from my own province no less) saying that community involvment makes trans women more depressed...

i understand this now. in ways i never wanted to. in ways that i never want anyone else to.

and the helplessness and hopelessness eats away at my soul.

i want all the ppl i care about to stop struggling so hard to survive. i want them all to be able to even have one fucking minute to breathe and enjoy life without fear or suffering. i want them all to feel important. i want them all to not be alone.

i want them to live.
