ok...

so now that i've realized that maybe its yeast causing my tummy problems after i eat bread

finding reliable information about yeast intolerances is actually really hard.

in part bc the common yeast is something u already have in ur tummy.

and bc there is a bunch of white hippy science out there about 'candidas'

making it difficult to separate information from white hippy garbage.
