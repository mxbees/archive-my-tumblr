to add some personal spin on it, i wouldn't actually move to the PH, given the opportunity. i don't speak tagalog and learning new languages is actually really, really hard for me -- i've long since given up on the notion that i'll ever learn to speak my 'mother' tongue.

then there is the whole... disability thing. unless i'm richer there than i am here (which isn't likely), i'm unsure that i'd have good access to healthcare. esp. mental healthcare.

transmisogyny in the PH is still a thing. very likely i'd be just as unemployable there as i am here, but without as much access to social services. also, given my height/looks/hairyness, its unlikely that i'd ever be 'passable' enough.... 

and, um, as an autism i don't really adapt to change all that well. for better or worse, canada is where i'm comfortable. when i lived in China i was barely a functional human being (if one at all). i barely understand proper social behaviour in canada. i utterly failed in China. 

my entire time there felt like a slow slide towards being permanently crazy. and at least, there, i actually spoke the language. 

i'm not especially happy to be a settler in canada and, thus, actively contributing to Indigenous genocide here. but leaving isn't really an option for me atm.
