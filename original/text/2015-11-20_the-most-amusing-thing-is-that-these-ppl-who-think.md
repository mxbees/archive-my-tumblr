the most amusing thing is that these ppl who think they're all that re: fact checking. 

did any of you actually google information literacy? one subbed 'media' for information,  so i'm guessing no.

and in the post I write

'it's a good idea to beef up your info lit'

which not a single person replying actually bothered to do. about info lit. 

it's all very meta.
