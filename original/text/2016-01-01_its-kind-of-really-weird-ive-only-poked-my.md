its... kind of really weird?

i've only poked my head into tumblr(dot)com twice today.

but i've been checking for original text posts.

its interesting how much less there is to my dash if i remove images and reblogs.

i thought i might have trouble keeping up with the ppl i follow....

but i don't think i will.

(so far as original text posts go, which isn't everything they post obviously.)
