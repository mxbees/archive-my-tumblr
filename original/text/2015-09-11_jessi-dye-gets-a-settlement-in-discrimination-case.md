title: Jessi Dye gets a settlement in discrimination case
---
> Last November, Jessi Dye showed up at Summerford Nursing Home for what would turn out to be both her first and last day of work.

> The morning started well. Dye attended a series of training sessions, completed paperwork, received vaccinations. She was excited about the new job; it seemed like there was a real future with the company, and they'd offered to pay for her training to become a certified nurse's assistant. 

> But then over lunch, she was asked to go speak with Robert Summerford, the manager of the company, about her paperwork.

> "What are you?" he asked her, as soon as she'd entered his office. 

> "It was exactly like being punched in the stomach," Dye recalled this week during a phone interview with The Huffington Post.

> On Thursday, the Southern Poverty Law Center announced that Summerford had reached a settlement with Dye. Rather than face a possible fight over Dye’s accusation in federal court, the company agreed to implement a policy that prohibits discrimination against job applicants and employees on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and to conduct sensitivity training concerning LGBT people. (The amount of money paid to Dye in the settlement has not been disclosed.) 

> Dye, for her part, hopes the announcement of the settlement will make it clear to other transgender people that they do have legal protection in the workplace and will serve as a warning to employers that they can’t fire someone just because of their gender identity. “I don’t want anybody else to have to go through what I went through that day,” she said.
