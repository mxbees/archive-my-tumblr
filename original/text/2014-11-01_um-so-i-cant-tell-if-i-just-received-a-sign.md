<p>um&#8230;</p>

<p>so i can&#8217;t tell if i just received a sign that i shouldn&#8217;t leave an offering for my lolo and lola tonight</p>

<p>or if they are mad that i haven&#8217;t done it sooner</p>

<p>i was posting something to tumblr about the day of the dead and how i was going to leave an offering</p>

<p>and my computer crashed</p>

<p>(i use linux, and i swear this is the first time i&#8217;ve crashed the entire thing and i wasn&#8217;t even doing anything particularly impressive)</p>
