i honestly didn't really think about the fact that ppl really do use youtube.

like. that it is super popular and ppl really do 'channel surf'

objectively, i know that youtube is one the biggest social media platforms

and that it gets a huge amount of hits

but...

i rarely watch videos. i don't have the concentration for them.
