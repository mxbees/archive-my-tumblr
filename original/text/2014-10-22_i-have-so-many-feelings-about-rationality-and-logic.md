title: 'I have so many feelings about rationality and logic. '
---
<p>Once upon a time I studied logic. And what always gets me whenever white people, esp the racist, sexists, or social justice people is how they go on and on about logic. </p>&#13;
<p>Never realizing that there is more than one kind of logic. There are logics. These logics are competing. </p>&#13;
<p>There are logics where 'or' isn't even a valid operator (i.e., classical Chinese logic). </p>&#13;
<p>There are logics that stress relevance (i.e., invalid arguments are both false and irrelevant)</p>&#13;
<p>There are logics that assert contradictions are true (yes, contradictions. True. And I've seen the math for this, it works). </p>&#13;
<p>There are logics that allow for degrees of truth. </p>&#13;
<p>There are logics for time. </p>&#13;
<p>For knowledge. </p>&#13;
<p>For every damn thing you can imagine. There are so many logics in the west.</p>&#13;
<p>There is also a variety of Buddhist logics, Arabic logics, Indian logics, some Chinese logics, and (I have zero doubt but never had the chance to study) many kinds of African logics. </p>&#13;
<p>Logic (and, thus, rationality) is just as diverse as the people who use it. </p>&#13;
<p>But this also doesn't account for cognition. Which tends to contradict logical systems. How our brains process information and make decisions has almost no relation to logic. </p>&#13;
<p>Western/white logic is the foundation for computers and computational languages. </p>&#13;
<p>I am not a computer. I also don't value the sort of 'intelligence' that computers have. They are not my ideal for rationality. </p>&#13;
<p>I will keep my emotions. I will use my intuition. </p>&#13;
<p>And I will also use my deep knowledge of logic to destroy the arguments of any white person, if I feel like. </p>
