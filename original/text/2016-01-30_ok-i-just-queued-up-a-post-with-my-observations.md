ok. i just queued up a post with my observations about how to do successful e-begging.

i've been hesistant to post this in the past bc i'm afraid it'll make me look calculating and then ppl will think i'm being 'fake' or whatever

but...

this is really just observations over what seems to work better over the years of begging i've been doing.

and, my god, i just want ppl to be able to get what they need to survive.

so if suggesting some ways to write better begging posts will help...

well. i've gone and done it.
