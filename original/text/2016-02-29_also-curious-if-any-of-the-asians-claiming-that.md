also curious if any of the asians claiming that Black ppl are silencing us or erasing us or whatever the fuck

are going to give Viola Davis any credit.

literally every single time i've seen her talking about diversity in hollywood, she uses 'women of colour'. 

she could just talk about Black women. but she is including us in her advocacy.

has anyone but me noticed?
