ok. but really. the most random (but maybe one of the most irritating) things that my anxiety has ruined?

my ability to enjoy stories.

the more i actually like a story, the more i get emotionally invested, the harder it is for me to deal with the anxiety of not knowing what is going to happen.

so one of two things usually ends up happening:

1. i put the book down and stop listening to it for like... three months until i think i'm actually ready to experience the climax of the plot
2. i go online and spoil myself for the ending so that the anxiety of not knowing what'll happen doesn't ruin me

(like. this book? i actually had a bad night of sleep a few nights ago bc i was so fucking anxious about the plot and what was happening. i literally could not stop thinking about it.)

super fun.

and this is me on medication. :D
