gah. i hate doing research on sleep apnea. it tends to be super frustrating. like this [article about comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea][co]. like. zero useful information there. 

i think what always ends up getting me when i do this research is that pretty much every source will say that cpap is the most effective treatment. but the majority of ppl with OSA (obstructive sleep apnea) are non-compliant: "Adherence to CPAP is often poor, with 29% to 83% of patients reporting using CPAP for less than 4 hours per night" ([source][co]). it always makes me want to scream:

'how is this an effective treatment if adherence is so poor?!?!?!?!?'

like. can u really say something is effective if the ppl its supposed to help can't or won't use it? super effective. lol. 

somehow, though, i always end up re-reading the same osa resources bc i end up gaslighting myself. like... 

'oh. maybe i'm just a whiny baby'

but. like. osa is a chronic sleep disorder. it has been linked to a lot of other conditions. like... i was just reading about how osa is often comorbid with chronic pain. so like....

but then i look at one of the main symptoms 'excessive daytime sleepiness' and, idk, it seems so trivial like that.

except that... living with it? and like. 'sleepiness' doesn't really cover it. fatigue is a lot closer to my experience (although fatigue is often a distinct symptom of osa...).

anyway. i'm not sure why my brain keeps trying to convince me that i'm not chronically ill. when... i have (at least one) chronic condition.

maybe its bc osa seems to banal.
