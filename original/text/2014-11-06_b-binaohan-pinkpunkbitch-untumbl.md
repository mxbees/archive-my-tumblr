<p>Friendly reminder that estrogen doesn’t change your voice so please do not make fun of trans women with non-cis sounding voices vocal training is hard thank you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is no joke. So hard. Especially if you’re older.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Support trans woman who chose not to undertake voice training. Support trans woman with non-cis sounding vocal resonance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes&#8230;.<br /><br />but<br /><br />also<br /><br />can we also just recognize that whatever voice a trans woman has, is a woman&#8217;s voice?<br /><br />like, this is all well an good, but the femininity of my voice isn&#8217;t determined by some cis measuring stick.<br /></p></blockquote>

ALSO

can we remember that not every trans woman does hormones?

which is why it is even more important to state outright:

every trans woman's voice is a woman's voice.

end of story.
