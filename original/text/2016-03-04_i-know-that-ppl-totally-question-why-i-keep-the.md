i know that ppl totally question why i keep the friends that i do...

not that i owe anyone an explanation

(but i'm writing this as a thank you to *them*)

my friends have stayed my friends bc they don't flatter me. bc they call me on my shit. they also support me. they give me comfort. they also keep me honest (and, tbh, sane). 

they give me the space to be me. 

in other words: my friends are awesome and fuck u.
