i saw this as [one of the low spoon meals](http://ihavenospoonsandimustscream.tumblr.com/post/131980144100/garlic-lentils-and-rice-with-greens) and i've been playing around with it to see how it goes. 

the original recipe was:

- 1 cup rice
- 1 cup lentils
- 6 frozen spinach nuggets

directions: dump everything into rice cooker and hit 'COOK'.
 
(The only thing I've changed it doing two cups of rice for one cups of lentils bc I'm poor and this stretches the meal out. i also add about a million more spices than the oroginal recipe. Favourite version so far: curry lentil rice. I don't measure so this is approximate for the spice mix i make: 

- 4tbs yellow curry powder
- 1 broth cube (i pick mushroom or veggie but i'm sure a meat one would be awesome)
- 1 tbs garlic powder
- 1 tbs onion powder
- 1 tbs ginger powder
- 2 tbs dried coconut milk
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tbs butter)

observations:

- green lentils are larger than red, thus they require more water and time than the rice to get tender (the rice ends up mushy). so for green lentils i'd add an extra cup of water.
- the frozed spinach adds water to the overall thing, so when i did red lentils it was all a little overcooked and mushy. for these i'd subtract a half (or whole) cup of water.
- HOWEVER, in both cases, when stored for leftovers, they actually dried out and had about the right texture (for me) after a night in the fridge.
- Overall, this is actually a pretty decent thing. I think pre-mixing the spices is what take me the longest time and it takes only a few minutes and this step isn't strictly necessary (you can dump the spices at the same time you put in the rice, lentils, and water).
