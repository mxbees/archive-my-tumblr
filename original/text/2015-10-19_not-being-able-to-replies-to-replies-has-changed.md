not being able to replies to replies has changed how i use tumblr a great deal.

i definitely feel like its harder to actually have conversations with people.

but.

in case ppl don't know: i'm not using xkit and replying to replies is more trouble than i'm willing to put into it bc i hate using the tumblr UI for posting.

i'm not ignoring uuuuu.
