ok. maybe 3rd times the charm.

here are some self-affirmations for myself to keep in mind:

- mild chronic pain is still chronic pain
- just bc ur condition is relatively 'common', it doesn't make it trivial
- if u have an incurable condition that impacts ur life on a regular basis, that's like the literal definition of chronic
- stop comparing yourself to others, your pain/condition doesn't go away just bc other ppl have more.
- stop internalizing the ableist propaganda that only Super Mega Disabled people are the only disabled people.

this is more like it. and it isn't 2000 fucking words. but this is what i needed to tell myself.
