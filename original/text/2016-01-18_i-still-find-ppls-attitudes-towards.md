i still find ppl's attitudes towards

'vagueblogging' or 'subtweeting' very strange

like. why, exactly, is this a bad thing?

ppl are always like 'why not just @ me directly?'

bc no one owes you their attention and engagement? 

maybe ppl just want to process a thing without making it a Thing?

bc not everyone is great at or desires confrontation?

maybe, just maybe, it isn't about you?
