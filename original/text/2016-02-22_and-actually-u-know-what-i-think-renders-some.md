and actually. u know what i think renders some academic shit more inaccessible than the language?

citational practices.

see. sure. poor ppl can absolutely read theory and understand it. 

but u get that not everyone has access to a good library, right?

certain fields fucking love writing dense theory that assumes all readers will have the exact same educational background and, thus, will understand all their references. no matter how vague.

you know what it reminds me of?

idk, less than a 100 years ago it was pretty common for scholars to include quotes and sources from other languages in their writing.

we do this now too. but at this point in history, they didn't see the point in translating the quoted passages. bc the only other educated ppl were other high class white men like themselves. so, of course, anyone reading this book in english will also be able to read german, classical greek, french, or whatever the fuck.

its pretty fun to read those books now and have no fucking idea what they are talking about bc they reference something you can't access and wouldn't know how to figure it out.

ppl doing critical theory love just referencing someone's name and maybe one of their Major Ideas and assuming that everyone knows what they mean, or has enough access to academic resources that they could find out.
