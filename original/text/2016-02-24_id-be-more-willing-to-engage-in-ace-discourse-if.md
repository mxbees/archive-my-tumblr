I'd be more willing to engage in ace discourse if so many of them didn't joyfully engage in so much horizontal aggression. 

like. I want nothing to do with u ppl. 

ur embarrassing. 

this is why I dont generally bother to ID myself as ace. I don't want ppl thinking I'm with u. bc i'm really not. 

I don't like u. u aren't in my community. if only bc i've learned that I have no community. but mainly bc I'd rather be by myself than claim u.
