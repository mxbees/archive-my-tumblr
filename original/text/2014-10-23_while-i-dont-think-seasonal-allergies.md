<p>while i don&#8217;t think seasonal allergies = oppression per se</p>

<p>it is possible to have them so bad they can be disabling.</p>

<p>i know &#8216;cause this is me.</p>

<p>(before i started on pretty expensive shots)</p>

<p>either allergies so bad i actually can&#8217;t function</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>so much anti-histamines that i overdose (not joking: i&#8217;ve done this before just to get through work)</p>

<p>and my best solutions costs 200+/year.</p>

<p>on top of still having to take antihistamines everyday</p>
