how's this for white transfeminism???

i just found out a little while back that 'trans feminism' was actually coined by Emi Koyama, who is you know _not_ a white trans woman. 

but she also gets super bullied in the community (as well as just generally ignored)

but i don't think i've seen a single white trans feminist ever mention who they even owe that framework to
