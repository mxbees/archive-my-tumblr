i don't think i've seen a single good argument for why these terms are necessary at all.

what's the point?

who is benefitting from these?

is it the most vulnerable?

what i really mean is:

how do these new terms benefit Black trans women? how do the benefit Black trans women and twoc globally?

does calling shit 'poop' somehow make it smell better?
