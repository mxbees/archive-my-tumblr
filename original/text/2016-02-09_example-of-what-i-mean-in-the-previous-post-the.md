example of what i mean in the previous post:

the person mentions that they cannot use to-do lists. but i can. so if i were to make a post about 'hey, here's how i manage my executive dysfunction' it would contain something like:

- Todo lists. with persistent, repeating reminders. and a snooze button. 

but, this wouldn't be very useful for them.

one area we are similar is that setting artificial due dates for things simply doesn't work. i cannot trick my brain into thinking that something is due when it isn't. if i have deadlines, they need to be externally imposed or else i'll ignore them.

whatever effective strategies i currently have for managing executive dysfunction are things that i've learned over time via experimentation and adjusting a method based on why it failed until maybe it succeeds or i have to abandon it entirely because it'll just never work with my brain.

if i were to really ever offer advice for learning how to manage executive dysfunction it'd be this:

experiment. adjust variables based on failure or success. iterate until you have something that works.

its time consuming. takes a lot of work and energy. and it may take *years* before you work out something that is effective. it sucks. its hard. 

but i sincerely doubt that anyone will ever find general advice written by a stranger on the internet that is *exactly* tailored to them and how executive dysfunction impacts their life.
