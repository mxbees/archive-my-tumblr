title: why am i posting all this biyuti publishing stuff anyway?
---
The main reason is that I had a long talk with Luna about biyuti publishing and its future. At this point... my general feeling is that it might be time for me to throw in the towel (at least after I finish with the current books in the works). 

The problem, of course, is sustainability. Biyuti Publishing makes all of zero profits (although, to be super honest, given how much of my own money I put into it, it probably makes less than zero). Zero income but it requires a *lot* of labour on my part. Things have slowed down in the past year or so as I was dealing with depression and just not able to keep up. I've been trying to get back into it but...

I also killed my actual career in the past year and now I need to write in order to eat. So... that's been getting most of my attention because it helps me survive, whereas Biyuti Publishing does not.

As I really start to think about my dis/abilities and try to figure out how to survive but also not kill myself in the process, I know I can't maintain three part-time jobs (my PT day job, writing, and being a publisher/editor). I simply don't have it in me. Especially now that I've started guilt spiraling over the lack of work I've been putting into Biyuti Publishing and am now actively avoiding work bc of the amount of anxiety it causes.

I feel the burden of what this is and what it could mean and do pretty heavily. I'd probably have already just... quit if I hadn't started working with an author who I know has pretty much no other options to get her work published. She deserves to have her voice heard.

But.... Luna really doesn't want to see it die. And neither do I. I still think that biyuti publishing is so fucking important. In part because of how I want to run it (ie, 100% royalties to the authors, paying everyone involved, etc.). Of course, these same principles are exactly why its doomed to fail. 

Given the capitalist world and given that I'm not, in actual fact, trained to do business of any kind, I am having hard time figuring out how to make biyuti publishing sustainable without exploiting other people (at this point, I'm the only person being exploited by providing uncompensated labour).

For me, an important part of the sustainability is... well, being able to compensate my own labour but also being able to get other people involved *with fair compensation*. All I'd really like to see is there being enough money to cover overhead and labour. Except that I know I don't have the imagination necessary to find a way to do this in a manner I'd be comfortable with. 

So I'm basically at a crossroads. Either I recognize that this is an impossible dream and shutdown or... I find some other way. 

I have no idea what that way could be. Luna wants me to try and get other people involved... but again, there's the issue of compensation. (Also an issue is that if I really start having 'employees' I'd need to restructure the business and how it works... which is a whole other issue). 

And so the future of Biyuti Publishing is uncertain.
