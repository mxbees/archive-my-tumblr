my impulsive brain has definitely latched onto the idea of hormones.

some reasons why it might be a good idea:

- bigger nipples
- some breast tissue to cover my implants
- mood related stuff (maybe i'll be a slightly less emotionless robot?)
- why not?

some reasons it might be a bad idea:

- could destroy my liver (only if i do the oral type)
- expensive and not covered by poor person's state prescription subsidy
- why bother?
- having to deal with even more awful medical professionals
- no more erections (i barely get them as it is)

more to come i'm sure....
