been watching gravity falls....

and tbh, i don't think its very good.

too much angsty young boy coming of age crap.

i think of all the kinds of stories involving boys and men

(and there are TOO MANY already)

i think i'm most sick of the 'coming of age' genre

bc 99.9% of these narratives glorify some kind of toxic masculinity.

this number goes to 100% if we're talking about white men.
