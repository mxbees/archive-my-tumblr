Alexithymia /ˌeɪlɛksəˈθaɪmiə/ is a personality construct characterized by the sub-clinical inability to identify and describe emotions in the self. The core characteristics of alexithymia are marked dysfunction in emotional awareness, social attachment, and interpersonal relating. Furthermore, individuals suffering from alexithymia also have difficulty in distinguishing and appreciating the emotions of others, which is thought to lead to unempathic and ineffective emotional responding. Alexithymia is prevalent in approximately 10% of the general population and is known to be comorbid with a number of psychiatric conditions....

Typical deficiencies may include problems identifying, describing, and working with one's own feelings, often marked by a lack of understanding of the feelings of others; difficulty distinguishing between feelings and the bodily sensations of emotional arousal; confusion of physical sensations often associated with emotions; few dreams or fantasies due to restricted imagination; and concrete, realistic, logical thinking, often to the exclusion of emotional responses to problems.

honestly. i didn't even know that this was a thing. i'm still not really sue what they mean by 'personality construct' (later on, it says 'personality trait' so... idk).

its funny. this explains a lot about my internal life and how i feel and react to stuff in my life. of course, now that i know this i honestly... care a lot less about the fact that i rarely 'feel' things (at least in ways that i understand and can identify).

i really used to think that there was something wrong with me (well, ok, depending on your point of view there *is* something wrong with me). but. meh. i don't really care anymore about trying to change this.
