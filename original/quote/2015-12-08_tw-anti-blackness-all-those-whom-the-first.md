(tw: anti-Blackness)

All those whom the first Spaniards found in these islands with the
command and lordship over the land are reduced to the first class,
the civilized peoples. Another kind, totally opposed to the above,
are the Negrillos, who live in the mountains and thick forests which
abound in these islands. The latter are a barbarous race who live on
the fruits and roots of the forests.

this answers a question i've had for some time.

this particular quote is from 1663. just another example of how anti-Blackness was spread all over the world by white ppl.

also note how this *predates* scientific racism (another piece of evidence for when anti-Blackness scholars say that anti-Blackness precedes racism, that it structures the white supremacy that would later create racism as a way to syncretize various discourse into one hegemonic domain.

later on in this quote, this person writes "Those blacks
were apparently the first inhabitants of these islands, and they have
been deprived of them by the civilized nations who came later"

the civilized nations being mentioned? groups like tagalogs.

just. fascinating.
