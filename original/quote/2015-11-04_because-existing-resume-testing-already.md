Because existing resume testing already demonstrates discrimination based on a number of characteristics like race, age, gaps in employment, and more, the study isolates gender identity. All of the applicants had Anglo-American-sounding names, attended college, were around the same age, had no gaps in employment, and lived in Petworth.

"The transgender community in D.C. and around the country is not all white, not all attended college, and because of what we identify in the study, many have gaps in employment," says Elliot Imse, director of policy and communications at OHR. "We're talking about the most privileged people in the transgender community and they still face a 48 percent discrimination rate."

lolsob.

ok. ok. i just shared a piece about resume stuff and disability. i've now seen studies that indicate that your _resume_ has a good chance of being trashed if you are/have:

- disabled
- a non-white sounding name
- trans
- queer
- a (cis) woman
- significant employment gaps (ie, you've been unemployed for noticeable amounts of time)

anyway. remember: this is just the resume stage. the very beginning of your job search.
