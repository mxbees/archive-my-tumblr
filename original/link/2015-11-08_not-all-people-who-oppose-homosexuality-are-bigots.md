omg. that title. but this is actually an interesting article. in the sense that if this becomes a real trend, ie that religious conservatives begin to use our discursive frameworks as a way to create 'dialogue' about why we are all bad...

which is actually something that i expect to see happen.

past experience shows us that when general, legal shifts happen like they recently did, all that happens is that those who hate us shift to coded language and dog whistle politics (the clearest example of this is with race).

although... a large part of me is deeply amused by the idea of a bunch of conservative christians sitting down to read _gender trouble_
