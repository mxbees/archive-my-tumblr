listen to this:

>She spent a year researching the case in which Northwestern researcher Michael Bailey was accused of mistreating transgender subjects. To her surprise, Dreger found the accusations to be politically motivated and unsupported. Her publication of the facts led to the accusers turning on her, quickly altering her professional reputation online.

>As a consequence, Dreger set out on what became a five-year-long journey to understand the impact that these scientists-versus-activists wars over human identity are having on democracy.  In her new book, she argues they are causing serious harm—and are being compounded by the economic collapse of investigative journalism caused by the Internet.

>Returning to her own roots as an intersex advocate at the end of the book, Dreger shows how the collapse of investigative journalism and the general cultural failure to focus on evidence and science ultimately harms the most vulnerable. She shows that activism still matters – but that it has to be evidence-based to be truly just.
