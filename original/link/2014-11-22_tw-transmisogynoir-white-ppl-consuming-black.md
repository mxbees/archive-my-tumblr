i was going to link this on [Girl Like Us News][1] but i just can't bring myself to do it.

here we have a white trans woman claiming the experiences and deaths and struggles of mostly Black trans women. She does mention some Latinas as well and one white trans guy. 

But mostly the deaths of Black trans women. 

she uses the royal 'we' 

like listen to this shit:

>When we try to preserve ourselves from actual physical harm, we go to prison like Cece McDonald. When we die at the hands of our attackers, they try to mitigate the crime with the worthlessness of all transgender people.

'we go to prison like Cece McDonald' as spoken by a privileged white trans woman is an act of violent erasure

maybe next year, all these super famour white trans women will decide that tdor can be the one day they stfu and listen to twoc (which twoc depends on the region). 

for her and this moment? why is this white woman speaking up for and about Black trans women? this keynote was given in Louisville. 

was there really not a single Black trans woman there who could've given this speech and maybe been paid the speaker's fee?
