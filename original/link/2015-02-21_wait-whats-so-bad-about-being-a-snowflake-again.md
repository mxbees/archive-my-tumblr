<p>like. i know where this phrase originates and why and how it is used&hellip;</p>

<p>but it is that sort of perverse d00dbr0 logic that puts marginalized people in a bind:</p>

<p>reddit trash constantly berates SJWs for being &lsquo;speshul snowflakes&rsquo; while insisting that many of us also uncritically and unthinkingly are just parrots for tumblr SJ ideology</p>

<p>we are, at once, both monolith and too individualistic.</p>

<p>which of course is the special kind of nonsense that anti-sj ppl love to push.</p>

<p>now.</p>

<p>&lsquo;speshul snowflake&rsquo;</p>

<p>has taken a life of its own within teh trans community, in large part thanks to the this generation&rsquo;s True Transsexuals&trade;, the (omg. i actually am too fucking tired to remember what their fucking name is, but u know who i&rsquo;m talking about. that group of largely white transbr0s who assert that body dysphoria is necessary and defining of the trans experience).</p>

<p>these white transbr0s do like to get at nonbinary ppl for having special snowflake genders and all i can think is&hellip;</p>

<p>so?</p>

<p>why <em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em> we understand gender (and the embodied experiences of gender) to be as unique as the people who embody them?</p>

<p>like. i&rsquo;m not talking about conceiving of trans/gender identities around a sense of white individualism</p>

<p>but um&hellip;</p>

<p>surely we can recognize that everyone&rsquo;s relationship to gender is structured by a nexus of unique relationships that only they are capable of embodying (because even if we just consider environmental factors, no two ppl share <em>exactly</em> the same context &mdash; we share the cultural broadstrokes, but only i am me).</p>

<p>cis ppl articulate &lsquo;speshul snowflake&rsquo; feelings about their relationships to their genders ALL THE TIME</p>

<p>(see any given masc4masc white cisgay doing mental gymnastics to prove they aren&rsquo;t flaming homos)</p>

<p>a plurality of embodied gender experiences is only a bad thing in a cisnormative world that insists that gender can only be experienced and embodied in a very few different ways.</p>
