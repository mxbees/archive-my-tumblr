Here's what happens every time I need to speak to you about something:

The customer service person starts with, "sir, I'll need your credit card number before I can do anything with your account." At this point, I cringe inwardly because I know exactly what is going to happen in the rest of this call.

"I'm going to need to ask you some security questions..." I then proceed to answer every question correctly because, after all this is my account.

We get to the last question, "What's the name on the card?"

I tell them my name. And then get this response, "Oh. I'm hearing a male voice, is the cardholder with you?"

To which I reply, "I am the cardholder. This is my card."

They go, "oh........ I'll have to ask you some additional security questions."

And now we get to the fun, super vague questions about my credit history. All of which I answer correctly because, again, this is my card and my account. My life, you know?

Now, depending on how much your representative feels like humiliating me that day, they either (at long last) accept that this is, in fact, my card and I am the cardholder OR I get to go on hold for an indeterminate amount of time. After which, I get to answer another round of security questions. I think this is the furthest I've gone down this rabbit hole.

The rest of the call is... well, still not fun. Your representative will occasionally toss out the odd 'sir' or 'mr' now and then, just to remind me that I am not a Real Woman.
