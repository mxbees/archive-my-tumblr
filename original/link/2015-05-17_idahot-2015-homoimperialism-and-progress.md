<p>So today is the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia. Yay.</p>
<p>What caught my eye today is this story, <a href="http://biyuti.com/a9">“LGBT Movement Making Inroads in Vietnam”</a>. The story identifies two examples for how the ~LGBT~ movement is making inroads:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>“It has entered public debate, been given airtime by Vietnam’s mostly state-controlled media and debated at the National Assembly”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“In late 2014, Vietnam repealed a law banning same-sex marriage. The new law does not recognise nor protect same-sex couples, but the move is widely seen as an official, and surprising, nod to the LGBT community.”</p>
</li>
</ol><p>The first point is, yes, a good thing. The second part demonstrates the ways that the ~lgbt movement~ broadly understood is a white homonationalist thing. Or, because we aren’t talking about the US, homoimperialism. Why, exactly, is gay marriage<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> being seen as the ultimate measure for progress? Well, because this is pretty much what the white cis gay movement has declared as its number one priority.</p>
<p>It all seems extra strange when you look at one of the quotes from an activist in Vietnam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Only five years ago, I think none of us thought about working with the law, changing the law. We were only discussing (how to address) stigma and discrimination”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, we can see that locally, this law banning same-sex marriage hasn’t been a priority.</p>
<p>The interesting omission in this story is the news I’ve been seeing recently about <a href="http://biyuti.com/aa">Vietnam’s progress re: trans rights</a>. From the story, it isn’t much, saying that the government is only considering recognizing trans people, but this has the potential to allow trans people in Vietnam to access trans-related healthcare and update their identity documents. Two things which would have a huge impact on their lives.</p>
<p>However, via the dictates of white homoimperialist standard of ~lgbt~ progress, only the repeal of a ban (not legal recognition or protection) is considered progress worth mentioning. And, no, this isn’t a condemnation of the article itself or the person who wrote. This is discussing the ways that a US-based homonationalist narrative becomes global and frames all narratives around LGBT rights and progress.</p>

<p>I know that the preferred term for ‘gay marriage’ is ‘same-sex marriage’ but I really think that this ends up being a euphemism. Especially in the context of this post and how US-based homonationalism creates a hegemonic discourse, ‘gay marriage’ is more ideologically correct. <a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
