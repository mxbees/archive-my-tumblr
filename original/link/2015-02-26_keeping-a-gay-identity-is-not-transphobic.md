>Another thing. The Stonewall riots were a violent reaction by gay men and lesbians to the constant raiding of gay clubs and bars, and the violence perpetrated by the police and others. The patrons were a mixed bag but mostly drag queens (the antithesis of transsexualism) and other gay men. They were not led by representatives of the transsexual community.

reasons why, despite it being tedious, everytime we see ppl talking about stonewall,  you need to talk about Sylvia Rivera, Marsha P. Johnson, Ms. Major, Mama Rene, and the other twoc/tfpoc ppl who were there and who started it all.

this ahistorical bullshit...

the deeply ironic thing about this? this is a response to the fact that stonewall uk (the gay org) is going to start (!) advocating for trans rights.
