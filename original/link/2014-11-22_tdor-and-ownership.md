<p>So thinking about the commercial aspects of tdor, i&rsquo;m now also thinking about concepts of ownership and credit.</p>

<p>This is partly <a href="http://biyuti.com/2">informed by my post on &lsquo;owning&rsquo; community derived ideas</a>.</p>

<p>So it is a fairly established &lsquo;fact&rsquo; that the trans day of remembrance was started by Gwen Smith, yes?</p>

<p>Okay. Quiz time though, can anyone remember without googling, the name of the Black trans woman whose death prompted the first TDoR vigil?</p>

<p>You know what the sad thing is? I can&rsquo;t remember. I&rsquo;m literally about to google for the name <em>right now</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_Day_of_Remembrance">Wikipedia tells me the name is Rita Hester</a>.</p>

<p>Rita Hester.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Can anyone tell me why Gwen Smith&rsquo;s name is mentioned in every single article about TDoR but not Rita Hester&rsquo;s? Why is Smith&rsquo;s name so closely connected to the yearly day of remembrance for all the trans women of colour who&rsquo;ve been lost to violence, but not Hester&rsquo;s? Why is it that Smith is allowed to continue to assert ownership over the day and its &lsquo;brand&rsquo; and, yes, continue to profit from this?</p>

<p>These are rhetorical questions, of course. We know what the answer is.</p>

<p>But I want to point out that every single non-Black person who has ever written about TDoR and not mention Rita Hester has helped participate in this historical erasure. This includes me. I&rsquo;ve written about TDoR and while I haven&rsquo;t spoken of the history, I have spoken about the appropriation of Black and/or Latina trans women&rsquo;s suffering by white ppl. And about the appropriation of twoc suffering globally.</p>

<p>All without mentioning the very first Black trans woman whose death became a stepping stone for one white woman&rsquo;s claim to fame. Whose death has inspired a global day of recognition of all the twoc lost to violence. Whose death now provides a platform for cis people, white trans women, and trans men of many colours to consume the bodies of twoc and appropriate our struggles.</p>

<p>So. Yeah. I&rsquo;m sorry Rita. And I&rsquo;m sorry to the Black trans women in my life for my complicity in this situation.</p>

<p>The decolonization of TDoR must start with Rita Hester.</p>

<p>Fuck Gwen Smith.</p>

<p>Any and all discussions of the history of TDoR <em>must</em> centre the role that Rita Hester played in it all. Just as any TDoR even <em>must</em> centre Black and/or Latina trans women.</p>
