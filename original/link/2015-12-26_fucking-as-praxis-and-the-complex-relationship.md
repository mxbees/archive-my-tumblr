**Length of essay:** 3500 words.

**Outline:**

1. Preface
    - this is related to yesterday's post on IPV/DV
2. Fucking as praxis
    - elaboration on an idea i first wrote a while back.
    - about how we use fucking as a way to determine ideological purity
3. The impact of fucking as praxis
    - if who we fuck determines our purity (and thus worth), then those of use who choose to fuck men are, ultimately, to blame bc of our sin/impurity.
4. Trans women and heterosexuality
    - trans women have a complicated history of compulsory heterosexuality from both the medical establisment *and* from internal community policing
    - 'straightness' and sexuality is complicated and complex
5. trans discouse is not a subset of queer discourse
    - trans/gender stuff is prior to sexuality and takes precedence
6. If domestic violence is a priority, then so much women who date men be prioritized
    - while DV/IPV can happen to anyone. and while, in a wider context, queer victims/survivors are erased/marginalized/silenced
    - ultimately, it is trans women of colour who are getting the most extreme levels violence
7. and, omg, can we *pls* make DV/IPV a priority?
    - but really really.
    - can we? even if this means prioritizing teh str8s in some contexts?
