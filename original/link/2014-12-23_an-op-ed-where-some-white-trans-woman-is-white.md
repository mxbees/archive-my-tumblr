i hate pretty much everything about this article. don't get me wrong... i do think she has a point. but her inability to properly frame her point just makes her sound like a giant racist.

so she can say this:

>While it succeeds in its diversity of skin color, it fails to accurately represent the body size and shape and weight, even the sexuality, of most typical trans women, nor does it do anything to highlight how these (admittedly beautiful) women did, in fact, contribute to the fight for transgender rights.

with like, zero fucking clue. 

her general assumption that all of the women are straight is... lol. go fuck urself. i don't know much about most of the women on the cover but... i know that, in my ignorance, i ought not to be making assumptions about their sexuality.

the fact that (i think) pretty much _everyone_ woman on the cover is a trans woman of colour is fucking amazing. but more importantly, it represents the women most vulnerable to transmisogynist violence (generally). 

and... the fact that her two suggestions for people who could've been included on the cover are _white_ is just... lol

>For example, Greta Martela is a trailblazer. She led a group to start a 24/7 trans suicide hotline - staffed exclusively by transgender volunteers. Or Julia Serano — the queer author of Whipping Girl, a quintessential book examining the intersectionality of transgender and feminist issues? If we’re really digging for trailblazers whose stories have been forgotten or overlooked (and you really don’t have to dig too deep), why aren’t they and other activists like them on the cover of Candy magazine instead of Carmen Carrera?

Julia Serano is a racist radfem. Fuck her. the trans hotline is fucking amazing. so sure.

but let me ask this question:

why does Carmen Carrera need to be removed to make space for these white women?[^1]

why, again, is the problem that trans women of colour are taking up too much space? and note, they are taking up space from teh ~real activists~ who do ~real~ and ~important~ work. ie. the fucking white ones.

[^1]: i'm not stan of hers but seriously? i'd rather see her on anything over serano's mayo face.
