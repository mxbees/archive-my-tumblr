<p>sooo&hellip;..</p>

<p>there is kind of this thing that is apparently going down? i feel like i wrote something about this, but maybe it was just on twitter.</p>

<p>anyway&hellip;</p>

<p>i find it interesting that i&rsquo;m seeing some ppl tweet about how teh ~community~ is tearing itself apart. or something. the origins of this <a href="http://www.donotlink.com/gtY">starts with some post about rupaul using &lsquo;shemale&rsquo; on drag race</a> and then <a href="http://www.donotlink.com/f1D">explodes when some other irrelevant white trans woman writes a thing</a>. now, i&rsquo;ve actually been reading a little of the news about this. mainly with mild interest and generally with a lot of &ldquo;igaf&rdquo;.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>what is fascinating about all of this is that i&rsquo;m largely seeing most of the discussion happening amongst <em>white</em> trans women. i haven&rsquo;t seen many other twoc discussing either the original issue (the use of a transmisogynist slur by gay cis men) or from the ensuing ~community~ rending discussion.</p>

<p>it is fascinating because apparently my ~community~ is being torn assunder and, well, my <em>actual</em> community doesn&rsquo;t seem to have noticed.</p>

<p>what does this say about teh ~community~?</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m far more interested in the divisions, gulfs, whatever, that this recent event is just sort of highlighting to the ppl who are actually paying attention.</p>

<p>what claim can there be of a ~community~ in any coherent or intelligible sense when it is falling apart but entire swaths of the members haven&rsquo;t even noticed?</p>

<p>what does it mean when when the members impacted by this share a clear common privilege and the member to whom this is irrelevant share a clear common oppression?</p>

<p>what are the stakes of this?</p>

<p>who is winning?</p>

<p>who is losing?</p>

<p>to a large extent, these questions are rhetorical.</p>

<p>the people who have always been &lsquo;winners&rsquo; will stay that way. and the losers will keep losing.</p>

<p>and at the end of this, none of the white trans women involved will have likely done a single thing to improved the daily lived experience of twoc.</p>

<p>so it goes.</p>

<p>obviously, i don&rsquo;t think rupaul should be using shemale on the show. not as part of the long running &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve got she-mail&rsquo; gag, nor with the recent episode. my bf likes the show and so i&rsquo;ve seen the past season or two with him. there are soooo many problems with the show it is hard to even pinpoint a single thing. like, the transmisogyny is front and centre every single episode. so is the racism and appropriation of the white drag queens. likewise with regular misogyny (&lsquo;cause gay men often are horrific misogynists). with good doses of fatphobia, body shaming, ableism, etc. and so on. need i go on?<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>
