Reading this pdf rn:

> Neglect accounts for over three-quarters of confirmed cases of child maltreatment in the United States -- far more than physical or sexual abuse -- but it continues to receive less attention from practitioners, researchers, and the media. Some reasons my be that neglect is not well understood and is difficult to identify, prevent, and treat effectively.

Of course, you see the problem here? its circular. researchers might not pay as much attention to neglect because it isn't well understood, neglect isn't well understood because it doesn't receive as much attention by researchers. lol.

> Neglect is by far the most common form of maltreatment. More than 538,000 children were neglected in 2010, account for about 78 percent of all unique victims of child maltreatment. In addition, neglect was either the sole cause or one of the contributors to over 68 percent of the 1,560 child maltreatment deaths in 2010.

like. this is what i find really frustrating about the previous comment and this thing as a while. 68% of maltreatment related deaths!? like. the lack of attention and resources if fucking rediculous.

> While trauma is often discussed in terms of witnessing or being harmed by an intensely threatening event, one or multiple experiences of neglect can also have a traumatic effect, especially in severe cases. One recent study found that, similar to physical and sexual abuse, neglected children showed signs of posttraumatic stress disorder and other traumatic symptoms.

Huh. guess i'm wrong about this. and i'm totally going to track down the citation for this because i want to read it. (like i literally just grabbed the pdfs bc yeah, i'm interested).

but yeah. i'm really not being... idk. conspiracy theorist about the lack of research and resources. a lot of resources will say this. 'neglect isn't studied as much or a well understood' but 'is the most common form of maltreatment' and ur like:

"i fucking hate academics and their fucked up priorities and bullshit fashion trends in research"
