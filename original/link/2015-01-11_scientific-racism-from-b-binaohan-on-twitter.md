just in case anyone wants to read the entire tweet thread on my thoughts re: scientific racism and today's discourse on race. 

click to get some historical context about 'white/caucasian' as a race and how race has become MORE reductive and LESS complex over time. 

click to also get some insight into why racism and white supremacy aren't, after all, actually the same thing.
