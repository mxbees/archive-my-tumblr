title: I've made a telegram broadcast channel :D

i'm feeling a little 'meh' on tumblr and twitter these days. and i'd like to try something different.

[telegram][1] is a messaging client/service. so far it is my favourite (if only because they have linux support which is pretty fucking rare -- and makes this one of the few cross-platform messaging services in existence). i also find it really fast and reliable. 

it is kind of like whatsapp, since you can tie your number too it. but i like it more bc you can also use a username, if you don't want to share your number with everyone. its also free and not owned by facebook...

anyway, channels are like they sound. if you subscribe, you'll get notifications whenever i post something (you can't respond, though). i actually can't tell (since i'm the admin) whether or not it gives you info to message me directly. i might put this in the channel description.

i know that most people are generally... unwilling to switch services or try new ones (unless there is already a critical mass of people they know. but telegram definitely fits more into how i've been using twitter at least (where i just send messages and don't interact that often with people). i also think that this is a place where harassment will be harder to experience since people subscribed to the channel can't actually reply to stuff.

also, this is a pretty reliable way to get a hold of me bc i'm always signed in. username: ninatee.
