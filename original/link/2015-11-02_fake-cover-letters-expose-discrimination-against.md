lolsob. okay. okay.

the first thing is, is that they had one 'person' disclose a physical/mobility related disability (spinal injury) and another 'person' disclose having aspergers. both were equally impacted.

but. ok. i think the number was these very qualified applicants got 26% fewer replies than the applicant one year out of university.

this means, based on what i've seen:

- if you have a non-white sounding name, your resume will get 30% fewer responses
- if your resume shows some relationship to gayness (ie, work experience or volunteering), you'll get about 30% fewer responses
- if you're a woman, you'll get fewer responses

remember: this is just the application stage, before interviews and all those other barriers. so. um. what the fuck happens if you: have a non-white sounding name, have a disability, are a woman, and are gay?

this is why i get so fucking mad about generic job searching advice. doesn't matter how great my resume and cover letter is bc my chances of getting a call? small.
