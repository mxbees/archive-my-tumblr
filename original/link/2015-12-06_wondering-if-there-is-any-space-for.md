Summary:

- I'm confused about when it is and isn't okay to engage discourses and communities that you don't belong to.
- There are often conflicting messages about whether or not external engagement is welcome
- some guilt trip you for not engaging while others discourage any level of external engagement.
- seeing both positions from one community isn't surprising bc there are no monoliths.
- generally speaking, i have these questions:

1. Should we care that there is a trend towards discouraging inter-community interaction?
2. Is there any value to inter-community discourse? Should we bother?
3. If the answer to (2) is 'yes', then what should this look like if 'solidarity' and 'coalition' are no longer deemed desirable.
