This would reduce the overall work a great deal...

since for $100, you're able to make a print-ready pdf. i also wouldn't have to maintain a server/hosting account (which is like... $400/year as it is + all my labour). 

i guess, even if i just look at the yearly costs... if i switched to using pressbooks to host the biyuti publishing catalogue, this means i'd automatically have the money to pay for four books to be ready for printing.... 

which, given that four books, given current available labour is more books that we could actually publish in a year, i guess this would be one way to reduce both costs and labour?

hmm.....

feedback would be super welcome.

(you can't read any of the books, more interested in feedback on the catalogue page. i'm kind of thinking that if i shutdown the biyuti publishing site with the subscriptions, move to patreon, and then give out subscriptions to the web-books from there, i could make a fairly smooth transition?)
