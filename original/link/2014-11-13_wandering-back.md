<p>In a way&hellip; this has been coming down the pipes for a little while.</p>

<p>Like&hellip;.</p>

<p>About a year or more ago, I made certain decisions which were, admittedly, ones I still feel good about. They were necessary at the time.</p>

<p>now? i don&rsquo;t think they are so necessary. or not necessary in the same or for the same reasons.</p>

<p>anyway. this preamble is all me just saying that i&rsquo;m going back to using neutral pronouns</p>

<p>&ldquo;they, them, their&rdquo;</p>

<p>if you please.</p>

<p>Politically (and maybe in my heart too), I&rsquo;m still 1000% with twoc. But. Idk. Going to Detroit last summer for the AMC changed a lot of things and gave me some (i think) deeply needed perspective. As did moving tumblrs and shaking up stuff so that I would stop my slow slide into complacency (and the harm that brings to the ppl I care about).</p>

<p>i&rsquo;ve mentioned on a few occassions that being an ~activist~ isn&rsquo;t what I want from my life. and it really REALLY isn&rsquo;t. at all. Not even a little. part of this is my eternal gullibility and how easily/deeply i&rsquo;m influenced by the ppl I have in my life. it makes it SO incredibly important that i surround myself with ppl i can trust and who don&rsquo;t try and bend me to their way of thinking/behaving.</p>

<p>the other problem&hellip; is that the little i&rsquo;ve seen of ~activist~ type communities is that they are just as shitty and horrible as any other community. they permit abusers and sweep the unpleasantness aside out of a desire to keep things moving.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to move any more.</p>

<p>I want time to stop and reflect. i don&rsquo;t want to feel like i have to keep <em>pushing</em> myself to be uncomfortable and go beyond my limits/boundaries/abilities. while i want to keep decolonizing my mind and supporting and fighting for the stuff i believe in, i need to be able to do this stuff within my own abilities and boundaries.</p>

<p>how i&rsquo;ve been doing stuff has been harming me.</p>

<p>i&rsquo;ve been so willing to sacrifice my health in order to do what i think people expect me to do&hellip;.</p>

<p>been so willing to subsume my self as Individual for the common/communal good.</p>

<p>i need to find a better balance between</p>

<p>&ldquo;yes, i&rsquo;m not the most oppressed and my privilege does oblige me to do <em>something</em> for those i oppress&rdquo;</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>&ldquo;yes, i experience multiple kinds of marginalization and survival is a fucking struggle&rdquo;</p>

<p>idk.</p>

<p>this post was just supposed to be me telling everyone to use</p>

<p>&lsquo;they them their&rsquo;</p>

<p>again.</p>
