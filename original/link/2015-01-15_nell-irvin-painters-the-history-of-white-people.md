I just spent about three hours power reading my way through this and it is just as good as the person who rec'd it to me said it was. 

Written by a Black woman, the book contains an important (albeit somewhat background) focus on anti-Blackness as the primary site for the creation of a white (supremacist) identity. 

It ably describes a lot of the history -- biological, anthropological, social, political -- of how 'whiteness' as an idea started in Europe and how it translated to an American context and the consequences therein. 

Importantly, it does not contain the myth that white ethnics like the Irish, Italians, et al, were 'not white'. As well as aptly demonstrating that the experience of ethnic discrimination by ethnic whites in America was because of perceived proximity to Blackness. 

I have some quibbles about the framing of some of the discussion (since the prior point is _there_ but becomes somewhat buried in how she talks about the 'expansion' of whiteness in the US -- by my reckoning, only the fourth expansion of whiteness really counts as a true expansion by deracializing 'Hispanic').

Noteworthy for anyone whose been following [Medieval PoC][1] and discussions about chromophobia and how the painted sculptures of the Greek were stripped of colour... there is important background for how this feeds into a notion of white beauty and such.

But anyway, anyone whose been following my investigations into scientific racism, if you want a fairly complete and reasonably accessible source, this is it. The language is not too academic or dense with theory.
