(note: this is a summary of the post content)

One of my big problems with Jenner is the way that ppl are passing her off as some... passive, agent-less person who has been thrust (perhaps unwillingly) into the role of Transgender Icon(tm).

But this isn't so. She is *making money* at being a Trans Icon(tm).

She has enough wealth and power that, if she didn't want to, she doesn't actually have to do any of this public stuff around trans issues. She is choosing to do so. 

And choosing to do so while directly contributing to the violence that some of the most vulnerable twoc experience.

I have no patience.
