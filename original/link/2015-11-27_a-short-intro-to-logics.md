The main take away points are:

- Logic is a part of philosophy.
- Logic is not based on objective, empirical 'facts' about the world.
- Logic is not a theory of human reasoning.
- Logic is not math (or computer science or any kind of science at all).
- Logic has no general consensus as to what it is and how it works.
