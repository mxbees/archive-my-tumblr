<p>It isn&rsquo;t uncommon to see Asian diaspora discourse focus on &lsquo;visibility&rsquo;. Recently, this was the apparently the impetus behind #asian invasion on tumblr&hellip;. a selfie movement feeding off of #blackout. There are many things wrong with this&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to talk too much about the anti-Blackness inherent in yet again co-opting Black leadership and creativity by doing something like asian invasion with little thought. There is already great critiques of this on tumblr.</p>

<p>I will talk, however, about the notion of visibility. And the inherent anti-Blackness of Asians either misconstruing the #blackout movement as being about visibility OR in asserting the need for Asian visibility at this precise moment&hellip;</p>

<p>From all indications, #blackout was not about visibility. To say that Black people aren&rsquo;t &lsquo;seen&rsquo; is to misunderstand and erase the ways that they are <em>hyper_visible. The problem isn&rsquo;t whether or not Blackness is </em>seen<em> but </em>how_ it is seen (and by whom). In one sense, #blackout was a great way for non-Black people to see Black ppl how they (might) see themselves: as a group of diverse, complex individuals with each their own stories and lives<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So what does it mean that Asians would create a parasitic movement based on #blackout that <em>is</em> about visibility? To me, it sounds like more of the (seemingly endless) Asian whining that racial politics (esp. in America) exist on a primarily Black-White binary, the exclusion of all other races. Now&hellip; this binary is not only false and non-existent, but organising around the belief that it is real is anti-Black. It ends up asserting that Black people ought not to be centered in movements for racial justice/decolonization/dismantling white supremacy. Or it ends up asserting that Black ppl take up too much space in these movements or discourse. Or something to that effect. Thus&hellip; we end up with the endless worry of (some) Asians about ~visibility~.</p>

<p>But visibility is such a nebulous term&hellip;. <em>Who</em> do we want to see us, exactly? And who are we erasing in this quest for visibility?</p>

<p>I ask this because if you are a non-Black Asian and during #blackout you either did not see or did not notice the fact that BLACK ASIANS were participating and, thus, &lsquo;visible&rsquo;, you are either following the wrong people OR operating with the notion that there are no Black Asians. Either is anti-Black. If visibility is truly your concern, then it should begin with <em>us</em> seeing all the peoples and Asians who tend to get erased and forgotten whenever we talk about &lsquo;Asians&rsquo;. Chief amongst this group would be&hellip; Black Asians. See also Indigenous Asians. But also disabled Asians, Fat Asians, etc. and so on. Again&hellip; I saw all the above during #blackout. Bc. You know. Asians (of any kind) are not mutually exclusive with Blackness.</p>

<p>But I also have to say that if &lsquo;visibility&rsquo; is the greatest issue you think Asians face, then you are 1) wrong and 2) probably in the group of relatively privileged Asians<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>One note: asking for &lsquo;visibility&rsquo; is not the same as critiqueing or discussing erasure.</p>

<p>I say &lsquo;might&rsquo; here because I don&rsquo;t want to presume to put meaning and words into the mouths of Black ppl. This represents, in part, my understanding of what I saw on #blackoutday, as well as its motivations.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m including Filipin@s in this group, btw. Especially if we are talking about the US, since Filipin@s in the US have the third highest average income of Asian groups. In Canada, we tend to be significantly poorer. But I often see Filipin@ Americans talking about how Filipin@s are the third largest Asian group but not &lsquo;visible&rsquo; in Asian American politics. <a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>
