<p><a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/brinkmann-on-business/os-transgender-rape-orlando-jail-20150303-post.html">Transgender woman gets $40,000 for rape at Orlando&rsquo;s Orange County jail &ndash; Orlando Sentinel (tw: rape, incarceration)</a>.</p>
<p>on the one hand, i&rsquo;m incredibly happy that she won. but i agree. $10k isn&rsquo;t enough for damages after being raped while incarcerate and after the jail ignored her worries that she&rsquo;d be targetted for being a trans woman.</p>
<p>i hope she wins her appeal.</p>
