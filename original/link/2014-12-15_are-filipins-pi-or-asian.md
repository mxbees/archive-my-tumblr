collected tweets about whether or not filipin@s are pacific islanders or asians.

like. this entire debate reifies the colonial, white gaze and its desire to categorize (and thereby control) us. 

the question is complicated with a lot of different historical shadings.

and it doesn't even get into the question too about the existence of 'filipin@s' to begin with, since this too is a white, colonial fiction. 

what if the spanish hadn't collected this heterogenous collection of islands and ppls and called us all 'one'?

what happened to the Malay race? what about the fact that 'filipin@' was once reserved for spanish settlers only?
