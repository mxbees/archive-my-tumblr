> The problem with how many people have applied this notion is that the claim that 'intent doesn't erase harm' has become 'intent is irrelevant in judging the ethics of an action'. Which.... really isn't a tenable position. 

> What do you do about accidents?

> And I mean genuine accidents. Because these really do happen. It's winter right now and a bunch of places are getting a lot of snow (particularly in some places where this is a really uncommon occurrence). If a person driving in these weather conditions gets into some kind of accident (idk, car slides on black ice) and the accident results in the death of another person... The above, taken to the extent that I see many people take nowadays, tells us that this is ethically equivalent to intoxicated driving. Both situations result in the same effect and from a purely consequentalist perspective, they are then equal in the harm they caused and, thus, both equally bad.

> Based on what I've seen a bunch of people articulate in the past four or five years, this is apparently what they believe. They believe that murder is equivalent to an accident because the harm is the same and intent isn't magic. Which, yes, intent in either case does not make the person less dead, but....

> Intent isn't magic, but it is important.
