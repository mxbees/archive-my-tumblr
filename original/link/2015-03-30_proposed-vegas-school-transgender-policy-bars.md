<p>so like.</p>
<p>this is totally the sort of thing we need to see more of. do u see how fucking entitled these cis parents are?</p>
<p>&ldquo;what do u mean teachers and staff can&rsquo;t out CHILDREN to other parents and expose them to hate and bullying!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>shit like this makes me hate ppl.</p>
<p>because these parents, to protect their shitty cis kids, want to be able to bully and identify trans kids.</p>
<p>fuck them.</p>
