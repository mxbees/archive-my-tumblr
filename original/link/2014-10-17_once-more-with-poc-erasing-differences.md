<p>soooo.</p>

<p>through a series of mishaps, i ended up being the sole person facilitating a qtpoc lunch caucus at the amc. not my first choice of things to do, because i have strong feelings about not being the person who &#8216;leads&#8217; in poc space b/c of my light skin privilege. i think i did okay with this, since i really just facilitated a discussion instead of talking at/to everyone else or even trying to direct anything. idk. it&#8217;ll be a while before i feel okay with this thing that happened. even if no one else cared.</p>

<p>anyway. the occassion arised (again) that a non-Black poc mentioned how they don&#8217;t like using &#8216;people of colour&#8217; because it erases differences and the specific experiences of blah blah blah.</p>

<p>we&#8217;ve all heard this before.</p>

<p>since this is <em>still</em> a fucking thing that people are getting wrong, here is Loreta Ross talking about the origin of &#8216;women of colour&#8217; (and thus also &#8216;people of colour&#8217;):</p>

<p>watch the <em>entire</em> thing if you are also thinking that &#8216;poc&#8217; is about ~erasing~ differences.</p>

<p>if you think this, you are missing the point. and, yeah, maybe you should stop using the term, since using this term fundamentally <em>requires</em> that you act in solidarity with Black women (and people). that you work on your anti-Blackness. and a major portion of this, is knowing where so much of the language and concepts that ~people of colour~ currently use comes from.</p>

<p>it means honouring the work of the Black people who&#8217;ve given so much to us<sup id="fnref:p100113690519-1"><a href="#fn:p100113690519-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>you don&#8217;t like the term? and you want to toss in some super &#8216;i&#8217;m the best activist&#8217; points in mentioning this and trying to look cool and everything?</p>

<p>this is what you are communicating:</p>

<p>"i don&#8217;t care about solidarity with Black women, first and foremost. i don&#8217;t care about solidarity with any other peoples oppressed by white supremacy. i only care about me and mine. "</p>

<p>which, sure. i get that too. but you should be a lot less disingenous about how you are making this claim. instead of trying to tear down the work that Black women have done, just say that you don&#8217;t respect their contributions and that you don&#8217;t care about them.</p>

<p>note: i&#8217;m not saying people <em>must</em> identify as a &#8216;person of colour&#8217;. When you listen to Loreta Ross&#8217;s words, it becomes pretty clear that unless you are understanding &#8216;person of colour&#8217; as a political &#8216;identity&#8217;, as a political statement, as about your explicit and intentional actions to work in solidarity with all poc, you probably shouldn&#8217;t be using &#8216;person of colour&#8217; to describe yourself. she says it herself. this isn&#8217;t about how much &#8216;biologically&#8217; you are asian, but about your commitment to work with people outside of this white supremacist, biological category.</p>

<p>if you don&#8217;t want to use &#8216;poc&#8217;. don&#8217;t. i&#8217;ve seen some people with good reasons for not doing so that &#8212; is this really possible? &#8212; doesn&#8217;t involve denigrating and misunderstanding the work of Black women.</p>

<p>but when you talk about how &#8216;poc&#8217; erases differences and creates some kind of homogenous group implying we all experience white supremacy in the same way&#8230; you only reveal your ignorance of history and your deep misunderstanding who people of colour are<sup id="fnref:p100113690519-2"><a href="#fn:p100113690519-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>well &#8216;given&#8217; might be a generous word in a lot of cases, but in this one it has the appearance of a gift from Black women to the rest of us. <a href="#fnref:p100113690519-1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>

<p>like. my dad isn&#8217;t a person of colour. yes, he is tagalog. but he fucking <em>hates</em> Black people. and he also <em>hates</em> the Indigenous people whose land he decided to settle in. he does absolutely fucking <em>nothing</em> to work in solidarity with other peoples impacted by white supremacy. he is asian. but unless he starts working on dealing with his anti-Blackness and working through his disrespect of the people whose land he settled, he&#8217;ll never be a person of colour. <a href="#fnref:p100113690519-2" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
