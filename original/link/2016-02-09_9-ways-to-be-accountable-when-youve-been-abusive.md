these also seem like decent steps for when you fuck up and hurt someone (in an non-abusive fashion)

however, i remember a friend recently ask for resources on this exact thing so... this is for you.

but i do think the writer makes an important point that there aren't many resources for abusers who want to stop and learn how to be better.

and... no, just saying 'well, just stop abusing ppl' isn't a useful solution. 

before anyone jumps on me: no, i don't think that support and resources for *survivors/victims* should be reallocated to helping people to stop abusing. but this is zero sum thinking.

if we want abuse to stop... it seems pretty reasonable to me that part of the solution is to, um, you know, support people in learning how not to abuse?
