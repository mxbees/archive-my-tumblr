I know some ppl on tumblr are using Open Dyslexic bc it claims to be 'easier' for dyslexics to read. It's just that... the font is fucking ugly.

Also turns out that the font isn't actually better (its not worse, but its also not better).

But the recommendations are also kind of scattered everywhere, so I thought I'd collect it for others interested in web accessibility.
