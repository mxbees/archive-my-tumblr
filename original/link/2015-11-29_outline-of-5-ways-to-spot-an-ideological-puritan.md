title: Outline of 5 ways to Spot an Ideological Puritan

link url: http://syx.pw/21mGr4y


1. [Introduction][1]
    - This is really what I've learned about how to recognize the red flags of [ideological purity][2].
    - It is also an attempt to help people contextualize their experiences so that they can hopefully get past the guilt and shame that accrues when you deal with ideological puritans.
2. [Prestige, charisma, and conviction][3]
    - Conviction and passion are key characteristics of many puritans.
    - These qualities tend to give make them charismatic and compelling.
    - In turn, this usually leads to prestige and influence.
    - 'Influence' is a type of power, but do not expect it to necessarily be obvious, especially in activist communities.
3. [Flattery][4]
    - The influence (overt or covert) that puritans wield within communities usually means they decide who is 'in' and who is 'out'.
    - One of the ways that they will signal that you are now 'in' is via flattery.
    - Flattery can be dangerous for vulnerable people bc it is nice to feel special, welcomed, and like you belong.
4. [Rules][5]
    - Ideological puritans tend to work with rule-based ethical systems (which isn't necessarily a problem).
    - The problem, though, is that the rules are usually unspoken and implicit, yet you're expected to know and follow them.
    - The other problem is that the unspoken rules (not being formalized) can and do change based on the puritan's whims.
    - The other other problem is that unspoken rules have unclear punishments, which tend to be disproportionate within these types of situations.
5. [Boundaries][6]
    - While boundary crossing is usually a red flag, puritans aren't necessarily going to cross your boundaries.
    - Instead, they'll manipulate you and situations so that *you* cross your own boundaries.
    - And this will often also serve as a way to test your commitment and purity (ie, your willingness to be a martyr).
6. [Shame][7]
    - Shame and purity go hand in hand, thus shame plays a large role with puritans.
    - Shame is one of the main mechanisms of control (ie, they'll shame you into compliance).
    - The problem? Purity is impossible (bc we are imperfect).
7. [Conclusions][8]
    - Ideological purity is about *performance* (bc it is an impossible standard).
    - Ideological puritans tend to not care about your actual context, abilities, or self.
