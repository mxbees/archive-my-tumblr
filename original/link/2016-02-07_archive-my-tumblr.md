Hi! This is the best way I could think of to 'sell' my archiving service. Under the cut/readmore or through the link is some general info about what I mean by 'archive'.

In case ppl need to know: digital preservation is part of my day job. What you'll get from this is an archive that meets today's preservation standards, in other words a real archival object, not just a data dump.

<!-- more -->

Please note that this particular purchase will result in me sending a download link to a compressed web archive of your tumblr. Web archives have the format '.warc', the compressed version you'll receive is '.warc.gz'. Warc files are the current standard for properly preserving a website.

And the archive will include *all* of your posts, including reblogs and the like. If you want only your original content, it's up to you to clean your data *before* giving me the go ahead. Essentially, this process takes a snapshot of your tumblr on the day and time that I begin.

Additionally, this process will not download any images, video, audio, etc. that you might've uploaded. Contact me if this is something you need (my hope is that you have all the original copies of these files saved on your HD).
