<blockquote><p>Knowing which major problems trans women of color are facing — discrimination, an array of socioeconomic disparities, something else, or a mix of variables — could help guide which policies would best address violence against trans people.</p><p>But until we have better data on the trans population and the violence they face, it will be very difficult to target any policy interventions that could help. And the epidemic will, tragically, be much more likely to continue. </p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width="500" data-orig-height="281" class="tmblr-full"><img data-orig-width="500" data-orig-height="281" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/469bd2e6286c07a4e4d853a9be2c67e1/tumblr_inline_nwjbttDHph1rdzs46_500.gif"></figure><p>No. This looks like a good idea, but as I mentioned before: state surveillance is not that answer. It might be good for temporary/short-term relief, but keep it in perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>The state isn’t going to suddenly start writing ‘policies’ that will actually help us in the long run. Not when the state is a huge part of the problem.<br></p>
