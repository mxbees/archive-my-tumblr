<p>the viewpoint that our languages are critical sites of resistance to white supremacy and colonialism in all its forms is fairly common.</p>

<p>and it is a point that i largely agree with. our languages <em>are</em> important and a critical part of our cultures that ought to be nourished and cherished.</p>

<p>however&hellip;.</p>

<p>i quicly become troubled when this viewpoint is expressed in ways that make it fairly clear that the person is working within some level of linguistic determinism. i&rsquo;ve elsewhere <a href="http://biyuti.com/blog/against-linguistic-relativity-or-the-sapir-whorf-hypothesis/">written about why i find linguistic determinism/relativism/the sapir-whorf hypothesis</a> to be a not-so-good (actually really fucking terrible) thing.</p>

<p>but how do we recognize language as an important cultural repository for our beliefs, history, and worldviews <strong>without</strong> implicating ourselves within this framework of linguistic determinism or relativity?</p>

<p>first. language has no objective reality or existence.</p>

<p>this fairly mundane fact often seems to escape a lot of people or is simply forgotten when discussing language. but it is critical for understanding how language can encode our beliefs and worldviews <strong>without</strong> invoking determinism.</p>

<p>it is just that: language contains what we, as humans, put into it. we determine language. language does not determine us. this is really how and why language changes over time, why a word/concept will mean one thing but in a few generations mean another thing.</p>

<p>language, as a technology, does serve to encode intangible things like beliefs and worldviews. it is a technology of preservation, since it allows us to pass these beliefs and worldviews to other people, but allows them to travel through time.</p>

<p>basically: language expresses the worldview of a people but the worldview of the people does not actually depend on language.</p>

<p>second. oral and written traditions are important&hellip;</p>

<p>but they aren&rsquo;t the only ways that we communicate and encode our beliefs and worldviews. a great example are rituals. while many rituals involve language, many of them also involve non-linguistic elements that carry as much meaning and importance as the linguistic elements.</p>

<p>or perhaps dancing. again, if this is done without music with lyrics, this is a method of encoding worldviews and cultures that does not depend on language even in the slightest. or maybe even music, since not all music involves language.</p>

<p>the intense focus and privileging of language as <strong>the</strong> most important way to access cultural repositories of belief and worldview often appears to discount the critical importance of these non-linguistic encodings.</p>

<p>to assert that one <strong>must</strong> know the language, otherwise you are not properly a member of the culture/people&hellip;</p>

<p>i may never get to the point where i&rsquo;m able to learn Tagalog, but i feel my ancestors in my heart.</p>

<p>they communicate to me in a space beyond/beneath language.</p>

<p>but i&rsquo;d never hear them if i was only listening for words.</p>
