title: revisiting the asterisk question

link url: http://b.binaohan.org/blog/revisiting-the-asterisk-question/

<p>it might seem odd to people that i&rsquo;m revisiting this question at all&hellip; but my reasons for it should be clear by the time we get to the end of this.</p>

<p>a while back, i wrote <a href="https://b-binaohan.herokuapp.com/blog/on-transasterisk/">a post discussion why the asterisk is transmisogynist</a> and, yes, i completely stand by what i wrote in that post. more recently, i wrote <a href="https://b-binaohan.herokuapp.com/blog/getting-under-the-trans-umbrella/">something about whether or not crossdressors and drag queens belong under the trans umbrella</a> and it made me realize that, as far as the intent and history of the transgender umbrella goes, the asterisk is actually a fairly good representation of this.</p>

<p>and while the person i cited in the latter post is a white trans woman, i noted that the fiction of a trans ~community~ hurts trans women of colour the most.</p>

<p>it is, without a doubt, obvious that the white trans ~community~ (like the white gay and white lesbian community) can only forge a path forward at the expense of decentering and pushing out twoc.</p>

<p>it is erasure by dilution.</p>

<p>as this all occurs to me, i suddenly realize that trans* is actually a faster and easier way to write</p>

<p>~trans community~</p>

<p>yes, i love the derisive and sarcastic tildas, but trans* has only six letters!!!</p>

<p>i find this greatly appealing to my sense of laziness.</p>

<p>and, i mean, i already use trans* as a way to identify members of a fictional community predicated on my exclusion and erasure. (ie, people who use it in all earnestness mark themselves as people i can write off and ignore).</p>

<p>but trans* is also a nice, concise way to refer to that imaginary community</p>

<p>so if you catch me using trans<em> in the foreseeable future, i&rsquo;m refering to the community that not only came up with a transgender umbrella in the first place, but went on to create the tidy and concise trans</em> as a way to further dilute, reduce, and erase.</p>
