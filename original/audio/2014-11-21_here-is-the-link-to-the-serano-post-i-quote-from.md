transcript under the cut

<!-- more -->

so. it occurred to me the other day, or rather, it was actually this morning

while i was supposed to be sleeping

that i wonder if

a lot of people understand 

why it is, exactly, that 

um, why groups of people like drag queens, crossdressers, aren't actually part of the transgender community

i say this because, like, Julia Serano recently put out, um, two blog post or, um, a two part essay on revisiting the term cis and trans and the distinction between them

and as she writes in her blog post and i quote

she writes, i quote:

>Whipping Girl was written from an explicitly transsexual perspective and addressed issues that I felt were overlooked by the open-ended approach taken by the transgender movement in the 1990’s...Here is what I mean by “open-ended”: Transgender was a broadly defined umbrella term intended to be inclusive of all people who defy societal gender norms. This includes many of us who nowadays identify as “trans” for one reason or another, but it was also meant to potentially include other people who are unconventionally gendered in some way.

end quote. and then i'm going to continue the quote... over here, so quote continues:

>In order to circumvent such problems, transgender activists during the 1990’s purposefully created an anti-identity movement, where one was not required to meet any specific criteria for being transgender in order to participate. Anyone could take part in trans liberation so long as they opposed binary gender norms. 

why i say this here, is that i know a lot of ppl especially on tumblr and around talk about how drag queens and crossdressers and similarly so-called cis identities/labels/ are

aren't a part, aren't trans, transgender 

and while i agree i also think that the

i also think that people don't actually quite understand why it is that these groups of people crossdresses and drag queens aren't transgender 

or why they aren't part of the trans community even though they were, when trans became an umbrella, they were intended to be included under that umbrella

and it isn't because they are cis, which i means, depending on the person they are. 

but also 

it also not a distinction thats... i think it is one of those fuzzy boundaries as opposed to a hard line delineation between the two um, and i have reasons for that

they aren't trans and they aren't part of the trans community primarily because they didn't, when the trans umbrella was first created, consider themselves to be part of the community. and, more importantly they don't now consider themselves part of the community now

and so

and this is, yeah, this is especially true if you talk about drag qeens and cross dressers

they don't consider themselvs part of the community

and thats, for me, what the important distinction is because they rarely work with us to actually accomplish and anything

and often they work against us via their participation in straight culture or gay inc.
