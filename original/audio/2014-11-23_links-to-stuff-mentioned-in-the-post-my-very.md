(I have vague memories of doing a diagram for the cis/trans tetralemma, but i have no idea where it may have gone. i can also do another if ppl think this is something they might find useful)

transcript under the cut

in my last audiopost i mentioned that i thought that the, um, boundaries between cis and trans are fuzzy rather than hardline dilineations

i have, of course, reasons for thinking this, um, and it actually harkens back to the very first post i ever made for the internet. my very first blog post.

where i problematize the distinction between cis and trans because of the existence of non-white gender systems 

and i know that in subsequent discussions with other people we sort of discussed about how 

a clear and easy demarcation who is cis and who is trans falls apart once you 

start trying to conceptualize and try and understand and articulate gender in non-white contexts 

so

i remember at one point i proposed that rather than, rather than using the white dichotomous logic to discusss this, sort of the spaces of gender, i proposed using a, borrowing from Nagarjuna -- the Buddhist philosopher -- to use a tetralemma for it

so that that the rather than two options there are four. there's trans. there's cis. there's both trans and cis. theres neither trans nor cis.

i know that we had some conversation about whether or not those latter two are coherent. and i certainly made an argument that it was.

since i feel that i know that people who would

(and by 'people' of course i mean people of color, not white ppl)

um, who would consider themselves, for example, neither trans nor cis

i also know perhaps

or might consider as neither trans nor cis if they were to, sort of, be presented with this framework and try to situate themselves within it

um, i also know perhaps some poc who would understand themsevles as being both trans and cis depending on contexts 

now i definitely think that these latter two categories are spaces where Indigenous and non-white gender systems sort of articulate themselves

or where their, at least part of their full expression are within these spaces rather than the primary two 

the insistence of white trans/gender theory that this tetrelemma is actually a dichotomy is part of how the discursive framework is imperial and colonialist 

saying that 

'hey, if you're Indigenous and/or a person of colour and you have your own gender system you must necessarily understand yourselves within this white framework and dichotomy rather than using your own frameworks'
