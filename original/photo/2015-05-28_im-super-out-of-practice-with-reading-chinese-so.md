i'm super out of practice with reading Chinese so... probably not great at this point...

but... once upon a time I knew Classical Chinese well enough to sight read texts without a dictionary (although... not with 100% comprehension). modern Chinese... i knew well enough to read journal articles and other non-fiction (i never spent that much time trying to read fiction, but was more familiar with stuff in my old field). 

getting to that level took... idk. four, five years? 

at one point, i was good enough to actually spend a year at a Chinese university taking classes and doing research (in Mandarin, not english). 

but... it turns out that i'm not really good with languages and i kind of hate learning them. too difficult. :S
