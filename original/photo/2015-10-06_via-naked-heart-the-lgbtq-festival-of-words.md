(via <a href="http://nakedheart.ca/">Naked Heart | The LGBTQ Festival of Words</a>) 

in case ppl want to see me in public for the first time ever, i'm doing this.

like. reading out loud. in front of ppl. 

expect me to be awkward and probably not very interesting and likely to run away from pretty much anyone who talks to me. throughout the weekend, you'll probably find me in various corners playing solitaire but... that's me in real life.
