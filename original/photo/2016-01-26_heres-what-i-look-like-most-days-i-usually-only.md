here's what I look like most days. I usually only share selfies of when I'm feeling femme and pretty. 

im fresh out of the shower. no makeup. wearing one of nine unflattering tops that I'm stuck with until they get holes or I get more money for clothes. 

they were $2 each. final sale. bought online. I hate them and they make me hate myself. good 'ol dysphoria you know? 

this is mostly to demonstrate why,  despite the pics most see of me,  I constantly talk about not coding as a woman and all the shit that goes along with this. 

why I talk about the disgust I see on the faces of ppl when I'm out. 

the glamorous life of a poor bakla.
