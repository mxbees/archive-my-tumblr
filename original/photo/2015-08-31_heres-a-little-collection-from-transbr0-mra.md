<p>hereâ€™s a little collection from transbr0 MRA twitter. you'll notice wonderful hits of songs we all love.</p><p>like</p><p>"not all men!"</p><p>"ur the real misogynist for saying i'm a man!"</p><p>"we are socialized as women!"</p><p>"trans women are aggressive and abusive bc they were socialized as men!"</p><p>"ur transphobic if u don't coddle my fragile masculinity!"</p><p>ppl seriously think this is all reasonable.</p><p>notice how so much of this is basically from the radfem handbook? like... </p><p>there is serious overlap here but these transbr0s are putatively part of 'our' ~community!~</p><p>and, bc they are men, ppl are _listening_ to them and taking this _seriously_.</p>
