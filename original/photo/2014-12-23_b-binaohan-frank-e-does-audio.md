<p>this is what i want from trans discourse in 2k15.</p>
<p>i fully expect to be disappointed</p>

<p>i feel like i’ve been talking about this for months. Like the overlap between the murders of twoc and the intimate partner violence is staggering. We are most often killed by those we are intimate with. But like, is the anti-violence movement talking about this???? noooooppe. </p>

<p>If I remember correctly blackfoxx has also been talking about the domestic violence/intimate partner violence aspect for sometime.<br /><br />I think before sueypark did her most recent anti-black misogynoir shit, blackfoxx did a video for that summer teach in series that may have discussed this.</p></blockquote>

<p>i may have missed when Blackfoxx was talking about this&#8230; but i wouldn&#8217;t, at all, be surprised&#8230;<br /><br />also not surprised that, by and large, no one in teh trans community (i&#8217;m really talking mainstream discourse) is paying attention.<br /><br />i mean&#8230; we&#8217;ve really only reached the point where _some_ of the white trans ppl i know who kind of talk about this stuff will say that tdor and transmisogynist violence is racialized&#8230; barely. <br /><br />sigh. </p></blockquote>

<p>to the person who tagged this with 'mogii'<br/><br/>no.<br/><br/>fuck. ur. umbrella.<br/><br/>this isn't about 'mogii'<br/><br/>literally about twoc.<br/><br/>Black and/or Latina trans women who deal with the vast majority of violence against trans ~people~<br/><br/>fuck. ur. umbrella.</p>
