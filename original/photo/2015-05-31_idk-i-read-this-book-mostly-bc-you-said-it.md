idk!

i read this book mostly bc you said it looked interesting and ... idk. i had the urge. 

its weird...bc so many essays in the book describe how one community or another navigates conceptualizing themselves as Indigenous....

so you get explorations of identity like "what does it mean to be Maori and indigenous?"

but not so much "what does it mean to be indigenous in and of itself?"

like the only comparative essay is written by someone who doesn't appear to be part of either group being discussed (I think it was Brazil and Australia).

but like. the questions i have about Indigenous, as identity, is what it means for, say, Maori and Aeta people to _both_ be Indigenous. 

like. the ways (both historically and politically) that 'Indigenous' has become a shared quality (or identity) between disparate groups of people with different histories and desires. 

like. how and why 'Indigenous' is used as a basis for solidarity with people outside of your respective group and what it means for how 'Indigenous' as identity functions in that concept.

and how all of the above relates to stuff like the UN's declaration for Indigenous rights and other state attempts to define and constrain Indigeneity.

not so much... how different groups understand themselves as Indigenous. i mean... that stuff is interesting but only in a general way.
