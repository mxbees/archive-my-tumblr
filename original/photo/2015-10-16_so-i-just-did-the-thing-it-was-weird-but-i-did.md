<p>so. I just did the thing. <br></p><p>it was weird but I did it and now it’s done. <br></p><p>

I stood in front a roomful of ppl and claimed my writing. 

I hope this is a beginning and not an end. <br></p><p>but. thanks to my ancestors. this feels more right than the mess my life has been for the past year and a half. <br></p><p>
now that I’m unemployable with a toxic reputation,  this is going to be my life until this too is taken from me.

but. I have no more secrets. <br></p><p>my name is (sometimes) nina mayala. yes. lol. i never left biyuti publishing but that’s a story for another day. so is the story of how I ruined my professional reputation and was sued for over a million dollars this past year. 

it’s nice to meet you all. </p>
