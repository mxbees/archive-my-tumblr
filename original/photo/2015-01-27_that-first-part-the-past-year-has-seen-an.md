that first part....

>The past year has seen an explosion in racial justice organizing in the U.S. as Black-led movements against police violence and racism have catalyzed communities in Ferguson and beyond. But where do Asian American & Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities fit into the movement for racial justice?

how do u write something like this and NOT see how anti-Black it is?

how can u claim to talk about 'North American AAPI diasporas' when you're clearly excluding Black asian diasporas while also using a us-centric construction (eg 'AAPI')?

like. idk. i'm planning to do AMC again this year, but fuck.
