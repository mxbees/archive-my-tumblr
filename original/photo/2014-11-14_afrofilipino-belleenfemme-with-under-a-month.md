<p>With under a month to Transgender remembrance day (Nov 20th) I am hoping this design is used and spread by anyone of any gender to build support and help make a small difference. <strong>Share to Care! </strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are inspired creative, and want to raw files to do your own thing, get in touch. Vx</strong></p>

this is literally what i was just talking about

what is this fucking garbage?????????

WHY IS THIS GODAWFUL SYMBOL ON A FUCKING STARBUCKS CUP OF ALL FUCKING THINGS

TRANSGENDER ~AWARENESS~????

fuck u.

FUCK U

i hate u

how, in any way shape or form

does this bring awareness to the material fact

that it is MOSTLY Black and/or Latina trans women (often also sex workers) (and also globally it is TWOC)

who are experiencing most of the global violence

and who

on NOV 20, we are suppsoed to remember them?

why are you trying to erase

one of the few fucking days where twoc are front and center???

ur fucking trash
