[image is the inside of a desktop computer]

here is my birthday build!

for my birthday this year, i put a bunch of computer components on my amazon wishlist in the hopes that people would help me get a new computer. and they did! 

i actually paid for a decent portion of this myself, since i bought the two most expensive components (the CPU and motherboard). but it allowed me to get a really nice computer within my budget. i was going to end up with something pretty underpowered (for my needs). 

i wanted to buy my components with the notion that i'd be holding onto this desktop for a while. i really want to get out of the planned obsolescence cycle that most electronic manufacturers have going. and now that i know how to put a computer together, i'll be able to upgrade pieces as a i need to. or just replace broken parts. i'm hoping this'll be with me for the next, idk, at least 10 years.

since i'm not a student, i don't need a laptop anymore. and tbh, there are very few, imo, that actually live up to their promise in terms of portability, power, and price (at the end of the day, 90% of the things are too fucking heavy to want to carry around a lot).

last... even if i do need to go portable, bc 80% (or more) of the apps i most frequently use are all text/commandline based, its actually just easier for me to spin up a temporary server in the cloud and connect to it with my phone or tablet. 

anyway. here are the specs:

- intel core i5 3.1 ghz
- asrock h97 motherboard
- crucial 8gb ram
- msi geforce gt 430 video card
- corsair 200r atx mid tower case
- fractal design integra m 450w psu
- d-link dwa-566 wifi adapter.

i think the part i'm proudest of is actually the wifi adapter. the whole wifi thing and linux gets a bit complicated but this one worked without any additional effort on my part. which is fucking *awesome*.
