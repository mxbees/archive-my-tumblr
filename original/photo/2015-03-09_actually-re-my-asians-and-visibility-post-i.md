actually re: my 'asians and visibility' post

i actually *was* saying that Black ppl need to be centered in all kinds of racial justice. 

i encourage you to [look up anti-Blackness as a theory][1] and learn more about how anti-Blackness is the structuring principle of modernity. 

more to the point, Black ppl ought to be centered because they are, in actual fact, already in the centre. the spotlight of hypervisibility shines brightest on Black ppl...

more to the point: so much of critical race theory, decolonization theory, and other kinds of race discourse are directly formed and structured primarily by Black thought. 

if our entire discourse is owed to Black thinkers theorizing about themselves and other Black ppl, i see no reason why it is an amazing claim that Black ppl -- not just the products of their labour -- ought to be front and centre for our movements.
