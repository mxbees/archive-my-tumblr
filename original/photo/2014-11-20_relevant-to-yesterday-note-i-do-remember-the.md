relevant to yesterday

note. i do remember the context for why BD is saying this. 

(not that any Black person needs a ~reason~ to call out any of us who are non-Black for anti-Blackness)

but she is referring to something that happened a while back (on twitter) when her and others called out dark matter rage for anti-Blackness _and_ their response to it
