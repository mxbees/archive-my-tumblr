<p><p>Now that I'm sharing images of myself, I realized that I finally have the opportunity to visually demonstrate one of the points I've been consistently making about myself (and of gender in general).</p><p>In which picture above am I embodying my 'authentic' self?</p><p>Which picture was I in the closet? Which was I out?</p><p>In which picture was I a trans woman of colour?</p><p>In which was I bakla?</p><p>Is this before and after? Before what? After what?</p><p>Did I transition? Where did I start and where did I go?</p><figure data-orig-height="251" data-orig-width="250"><img src="https://38.media.tumblr.com/10627d114c6cf5e7ee2e027959b76000/tumblr_inline_nwu937YE7I1rdzs46_500.gif" data-orig-height="251" data-orig-width="250"></figure></p>
