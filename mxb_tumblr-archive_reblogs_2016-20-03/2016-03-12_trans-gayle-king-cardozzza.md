<p>how many of y'alls posts have made it onto tumblr.in.action</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i think i got on there once or twice a long time ago it was wild</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i was on there once. if you’ve heard of “the time someone defended mayonnaise as a gender”, that was me. i admit i could’ve worded that better but bad wording does not warrant suicide baiting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got on there twice that I know of, but it’s funny because the posts I got on for weren’t even ~offensive~ or whatever?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I lost count. There was a point during RileyGate 2013 when I was getting traffic on there every other day ^_^</p>

i've lost count too. 

i stopped looking at my blog stats so i have no idea how frequently it happens these days.
