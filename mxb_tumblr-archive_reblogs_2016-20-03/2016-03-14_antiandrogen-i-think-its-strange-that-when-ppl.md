<p>i think its strange that when ppl start playing with makeup they just pick up lip and eye products and donâ€™t logically start with complexion products. my advice: if u wanna start getting into wearing makeup, learn how to perfect the skin first and then everything else will come together easily</p>

this was totally me. i think complection stuff was what i did last.

but overall i'm still shitty at makeup.
