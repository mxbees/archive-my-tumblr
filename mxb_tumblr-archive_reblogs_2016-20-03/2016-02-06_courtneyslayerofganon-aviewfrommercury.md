<p><em>shakes fist at python</em></p>

<p>bc i’m a loser, i decided to learn ruby instead of python.</p>

<p>and now i’m realizing that i really ought to have learned python.</p>

<p>for the sort of work i do, python would be soooo much more useful.</p>

<p>and then a lot of the scripts i’m currently using are python, not ruby.</p>

<p>and i can’t edit them bc i don’t know anything about python.</p>

<p>:(</p>

<p>On the bright side, python is fairly easy to learn :)</p>

<p>i have to disagree here. ruby is a simple language with a lot of expansion available.<br></p>

lol. 

i wasn't intending to start a ruby vs python battle. 

from what i understand both are about the same in terms of how easy it is to learn them.

both are good but, as i've learned, they have strengths and weaknesses.

from what i've observed python is much better for dealing with the sort of data i typically deal with (especially at work). every time i need to try and solve a problem and google it, i end up finding a bunch of python solutions.

this is why i should switch.

also... my frustration about learning here is that self-directed learning, for me, is really really hard. it's taken me about... idk, three or four years to get a rudimentary knowledge of ruby. switching to python now means having to spend another three or four years re-learning everything. this is all a statement about how i learn and my cognitive limitations, rather than any feature of either language.
