<p>So it finally happened. In a week, I will no longer be employed. Seeing as it took years to get this job, I feel safe assuming I wouldn’t find a new job that meets my needs in time for things not to fall completely apart here and seeing as we have been scraping by financially for some time now, we are having a hard time going about it. We could really use some help moving somewhere else.</p>

<p>If anyone could donate to help us move it would be greatly appreciated. We also have a posting on the Trans Housing Network searching for a place to crash in San Francisco so we can have time to search for jobs and get on our feet, and spreading the word would greatly help cut costs. If you can’t donate, please at least boost this post.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>There is also a <b>YouCaring fundraiser</b> describing our situation in more detail where you can donate. <a href="https://www.youcaring.com/j-r-culinarycourtesan-e-l-dearestcreatures-495138">Click here to reach our fundraiser</a>!</p>

Either way, boost if you can’t.</p>

<p>(Feel free to message either of us, but please, no hate. You will be blocked, no exceptions. I just don’t have the energy anymore to deal with trolls and phobes of any sort anymore.)</p>

<p>Officially unemployed and my anxiety is starting to skyrocket. Donations have been very slow and I am getting very scared about not having anywhere to stay in a month. Please, if you can’t donate, boost. Most of the notes on this post are from reblogging. Please boost this post.</p>

<p>I unfortunately do not have enough time to get someone to sublease my apartment so I will be forced to pay for another month of rent here in Tampa. Please, if anyone can help, we would really appreciate it. We only have a few days before rent is due.</p>

<p>We are kinda out of money and need money for food…</p>

<p>And again, no luck saving up for a new place or finding a temporary home we could move to. Rent was due yesterday. I’m feeling so empty and numb. I don’t know what to do and it’s… so scary… Please help circulate our posts. Things are getting worse here at home…</p>
