<p>oh. also?</p>

<p>here’s another form of widely supported racial eugenics:</p>

<p>poc in the third world (and first world too)</p>

<p>are constantly being told that there are too many of us and we are having too many babies and that we need to stop.</p>

<p>this whole ‘overpopulation’ thing is a widely supported form of eugenics by many white ppl. who often do not see a problem with it and will happily defend it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly I see so many whites advocating abstaining from having children as a personal decision, but then taking it the (typical) step further and forcing this dynamic onto people of color via emotional blackmail and, of course, systemic racism via politics.<br><br>Liberals make it into a “Save the world by not having kids” and guess who gets to be the burden of having too many kids? As you said.<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>god yes.</p>

<p>whenever i see white ppl pushing this form of eugenics (something environmental activists fucking love)</p>

<p>the only thing i can think of is:</p>

<p>if you think overpopulation is a serious issue, then kill yourself and be part of the solution, instead of continuing to be part of the problem.</p>

<p>if you really think this is a problem and you’re so committed to the ~cause~ why the fuck are you still standing in front of me advocating for eugenics?</p>

<p>Well DAMN.<br><br>(I mean, I agree lmao but DAMN you just went in, no holdin back).<br><br>“Be the martyr you wish to see in the world*.”<br><br>*And impose on other people with your racism and ideological purity</p>

omfg

'be the martyr you wish to see in the world'

i'm fucking screaming.

apparently it turns out that eugenics is a hot button topic with me. i mean... i care a lot about various things but it seems that 'soft genocide' really fucking gets to me.

this and environmental racism... so i guess combine the two and i'm fucking done.
