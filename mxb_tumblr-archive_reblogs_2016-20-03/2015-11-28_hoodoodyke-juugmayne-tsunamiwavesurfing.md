<p>I’m curious if those of you in black tumblr who criticize Asian family businesses in black neighborhoods as being predatory, </p>
<p>do you turn that criticism towards yourselves as well for taking part in US military as soldiers as well as being English teachers? Because I’ve seen quite a few side with White people telling Koreans to be “grateful” for “saving” Korea and “protecting” them for the horrible North.</p>

<p>It’s wild how this is the counter argument. Like “hey I see you called my people out and the only way to resolve it is to admit we’re wrong, you’ve activated my “duck taking responsibility for our wrongs by flipping the topic” trap card.“</p>

<p>Thanks for using the <a href="http://mxb.ca/post/133602959644/the-competing-rights-derail">competing rights/callout derail,</a> here’s your prize:</p>
<figure data-orig-width="384" data-orig-height="288" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://38.media.tumblr.com/64feee115f1d1a1ff99b7b132db09a3b/tumblr_inline_nyjg69wkjU1qfzb2v_500.gif" alt="image" data-orig-width="384" data-orig-height="288"></figure><p>I mean, it can’t POSSIBLY be that Asian Americans are exploiting Black Americans on top of treating them like thieving roaches, AND individuals reinforcing imperialism. </p>
<p>Another person could easily say, “If you’re talking about imperialism from the US to Asia, are you going to talk about Asia’s systemic imperialism in Africa?” (<a href="http://hoodoodyke.tumblr.com/post/121300902824/swahiliilunga-onyourtongue-fruit-goddess">http://hoodoodyke.tumblr.com/post/121300902824/swahiliilunga-onyourtongue-fruit-goddess</a> and  <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=china%20colonizing%20africa">https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=china%20colonizing%20africa</a>). But, it doesn’t matter, because that wasn’t your actual point and you don’t reeeeally care about these things so much as you want to dodge accountability and get Black Americans to shut up and pay real money for their own oppression, in their own homes.</p>
<p>This is going to go in a circle, which was your intent, because you deliberately sought to undermine Black people’s conversations about how we’re being oppressed. </p>
<p>So yeah, eat a thousand dicks, and choke on em.</p>

i also like the assumption that 'Black tumblr' is a monolith...

i mean. 

i don't think *any* of the Black people whose posts i regularly see have anything 'positive' to say about the US military or cops. even if they happen to be Black.

the thing is. if ur hanging around the sorts of Black (and white) people who really do think that US military intervention *anywhere* is a good thing or that white ppl doing as they do in poc countries is 'good'...

honestly? that says a lot more about you than 'Black tumblr'.

but also. the above. 

this is a *great* example of the callout derail. 

unfortunately for this person, many of us are capable of caring about more than one thing at a time.

like. yeah. i care about Asian owned businesses in Black neighbourhoods. i care about Asian appropriation of Black culture. i also care a great deal about the fact that there's 6000 american soldiers in the PH right now. i care a great deal about american war mongering in asia *and* the rest of the world.

its a shame you appear to only care about yourself.
