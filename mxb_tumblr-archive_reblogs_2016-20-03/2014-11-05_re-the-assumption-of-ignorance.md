<blockquote><p>I find <a href="http://thesavagesalad.tumblr.com/post/34747867375/im-never-gonna-dispute-the-terminology-of">the consistent request from cis feminists </a>to trans feminine people to have historical knowledge to be entirely puzzling. </p>
<p>Like beyond the classist implications of telling us we need to understand the entire history of people who oppress us so that we can see the &#8216;good&#8217; they&#8217;ve allegedly given the world&#8230;</p>
<p>Why is it that the assumption is that we don&#8217;t know? That phrases like &#8216;cis scum&#8217; or &#8216;radscum&#8217; might actually have come about with the full knowledge of just what radical feminism (and non-radical feminism) is? </p>
<p>Why are we assumed to be ignorant of a movement that is unabashedly all about oppressing people? </p>
<p>Is it because we&#8217;ve coined the terms &#8216;cis scum&#8217; or &#8216;radscum&#8217;? Because we are angry? What? </p>
<p>I see the history of feminism. </p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t hard to locate it in a larger white supremacist, colonial framework designed to oppress all poc generally, and in later years especially with radfemninsm, trans woc in particular. </p>
<p>I dislike feminism because I know its history. </p>
<p>But even if I didn&#8217;t know of some theoretical good it did 40 years ago&#8230;</p>
<p>Tell me why I should care now, when their rhetoric and advocates are responsible for denying necessary services to trans women right now? </p></blockquote>
