<p>Been seeing a lot recently about the supposed male socialization of trans women…. both from cis ppl and trans women. This is my contribution for why it is incoherent and just a silencing and oppressive and transmisogynist tool.</p>

<p>First…. there is this notion that children, depending on assigned sex, get one message about gender stuff and not the other. This is largely nonsensical. We all get the exact <strong>same</strong> message. Because ideas and oppression don’t exist in isolation (this is pretty much the foundation of intersectionality). For the most part, the message boils down to (if'n we’re talking just about gender):</p>

<p>Boys rule and girls drool.</p>

<p>Or something to that effect. Both boys and girls are socialized to behave as if this were true. It isn’t that boys are taught that girls are subservient and that girls are taught to defer to boys. Well, yes, we are taught that, but these are behavioural patterns designed to inculcate all genders with the same message. Children of all genders are socialized to behave in ways that assume only two genders and that one of those genders (girls) is worth far less than the other gender.</p>

<p>So. If we are all getting the same message, how to the difference arise between how one child embodies this message and how another does? Well, largely based on which gender they are told they are mixed with whatever gender they actually are. Outside of the rare moments where you are explicitely and on an individual basis told the message, most of the time we sort of…. just pick this up from our peers, how our parents interact with one another, what we see on tv, what we read in books, etc.</p>

<p>And that is the thing. We all watch (within certain variations) the same shows. Read the same books. Because, um, you know, we all lived in the same culture (obvs. relative to geography but I’m working on a really macro basis rn).</p>

<p>It blows my mind that all these feminist media critics or whatever can spend their lives deconstructing the harmful messages encoded in many of our cultural products and practices and somehow think that trans girls didn’t internalize and embody these things as well.</p>

<p>For example. Just on the impossible standards of beauty alone. We hear a lot from cis women who talk about how this impossible ideal beauty destroys confidence and self-worth and self-esteem, but can’t quite make the leap to how this impacts trans girls.</p>

<p>We see the same impossible ideal of beauty. And I’m not sure if you’ve realized (although, since many of you take exquisite pleasure in de/misgendering us, i’m sure you <em>do</em> realize), just how distant that ideal is for your average trans woman. Especially if you transition late. Many of us understand that even if we go through the entire gamut of surgeries/hormones/whatever we will <strong>never</strong> be beautiful. We will never be desirable. We will never be attractive. And, the thing is, this isn’t a newborn realization.</p>

<p>Why? Becasuse we’ve been exposed to and socialized with the <strong>exact same</strong> impossible beauty standards that cis women were. Because. You know, we share the same cultural and were likewise socialized <strong>together</strong>.</p>

<p>There is no ‘male socialization’ and no ‘female socialization’. We are all just socialized in a culture that devalues and oppresses women. And these social behaviours are supported and rewarded and enforced by our institutions.</p>

<p>This is true to an extent, but it’s not the whole story. What you’ve said is pretty much true! But it leaves a large part out of the picture - the way that <i>individuals </i>are treated. I think this is where many people involved in this discussion are talking past each other, and not realizing it. </p>
<p>Yes, we get the same messages about what women should be like and what men should be like, and internalize them, and they affect trans people just as much as cis people. </p>
<p>But people do <i>not</i> get treated the same, and much of the way we are treated depends on presumed gender - <i>and</i> most of the time it’s not even explicitly stated that it’s being done because of our presumed gender. That’s where difference in socialization can come into play and be a factor. It’s not just the messages you receive about gender as a whole, it’s the treatment and opportunities (or lack thereof) that you, personally, get as a child or teen. Oftentimes, you don’t even realize they’re dependent on your gender until later, looking back, and even then, that doesn’t change the fact that you got those opportunities, those chances, and that encouragement (or their lack).</p>
<p>How many little cis boys do you know who don’t realize the extent to which their voices are listened to over those of little girls simply because they are seen as boys? The correct answer is…pretty much all of them. How many little cis boys don’t even know that they’ve been more encouraged to learn about math than cis girls their age simply because they are seen as boys? Once again, a whole lot. Other examples are true for cis girls. And most of them happen to trans kids too, because they’re generally seen/treated as their assigned gender. </p>
<p>Basically, the lessons and opportunities you get are influenced by your presumed gender, 

and that’s part of your socialization. So, frequently (not always), trans men still have a childhood of being taught to be quiet, demure, accommodating, caring, etc (again - this refers to being <i>personally trained </i>to act this way, which is different from being taught that that’s how girls in general ought to be). Frequently (not always), trans women still have a childhood of being taught to be louder, bolder, interrupt people, etc. That is factually true, and it does matter. It doesn’t make trans women “not women” or trans men “not men”, nor make trans women horrible loud evil entitled monsters or anything whatsoever like that, but it does mean that denying that there’s <i>any</i> difference there is false.<br></p>
<p>I’m also curious how you explain the fact that many trans women say they <i>did </i>experience male-typical socialization growing up, and many trans men that they <i>did </i>experience female-typical socialization growing up, if your claim that that <i>never</i> happens is true. </p>

\*rolls eyes\*

So what you're saying here is that ~male~ and ~female~ socialization does exist. Because little boys and little girls are treated differently. 

But all you're doing is shifting the issue to a slightly different arena. All you did was basically prove my point by using a bunch of generalizations that are pretty much only true of white kids. 

But anyway. Let's take the math example since I'm reasonably familiar with that. In the past I've definitely talked about the concept of 'stereotype threat' wherein marginalized people will perform worse on certain tasks if we think that our performance will be seen as representive of our group as a whole. One of the main ways they've tested this is with women and math. Women if primed with sexist messages will do worse on a math test than men. However, they'll do just as well if they aren't primed with these same messages. Stereotype threat has been observed with various races and etc.

(Sidenote: the fact that you use 'trained' to describe socialization is pretty special.)

So you're not exactly wrong. However, what you're discounting is how other people's treatment of us gets internalized. Which is the same as any external socialization. 

Because all you're describing is the method by which cognitive dissonance is created in trans kids, usually resulting in *social* dysphoria. Which appears to be something you've forgotten that exists. Being treated like a boy when you aren't a boy creates cognitive dissonance and internal distress. Its hard to just.... internalize how other people treat you when it fundamentally conflicts with your sense of self.

To answer your last question, I never claim that it doesn't happen just that everyone's experience of socialization is unique to them. Which is pretty much all you say yourself, since we are all treated differently.

But you realize that people are totally able to describe their own experiences however they'd like, but this doesn't necessarily make their concepualization *true*. Its perfectly possible (and frequently occurs) for people to be honestly mistaken about how we understand our own experiences.
