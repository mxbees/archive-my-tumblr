<p>Wait, how?</p>

the thing that gets me about most shows/movies/whatever that have time travel is that they rarely stay consistent on their view of time.

does time travel cause paradoxes and change the future? or does time travel make no difference? 

the gargoyles picked the later and have been sticking with it. so there are working on a deterministic (vs. free choice) model of time. everything that happens is conditioned on what happened before, thus, time and events are immutable. 

there are other things too... but for me? the main thing is consistency.

off the top of my head i can think of only two other things that i've read that do time travel right imo.

that's... donnie darko and (a book) _the man who folded himself_.
