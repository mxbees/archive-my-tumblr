<p>i reiterated a point i’ve made before on twitter yesterday…</p>

<p>what do ppl actually think happend to childhood bullies?</p>

<p>grow a heart of gold after some teachable moment? disappear in a cloud of fairy dust? ascend to a plane of higher existence? what?</p>

<p>its just like the post about how white millenials are just as racist as their parents and grandparents.</p>

<p>like. racism isn’t some innate behaviour. its learned.</p>

<p>just like bullies learn that their abusive behaviours will rarely result in any kind of consequence. so they grow up to be the sorts of adults that yell at cashiers. who play petty bullshit politics at work. grow up to be parents that abuse their children.</p>

<p>u don’t just ‘grow’ out of being a bully. not when abuse culture ensures that this behaviour is both normalized and rewarded.</p>

based on a comment i just got, i wanted to make something clear about what the purpose of this post was, since this person got me to understand that there is at least one way to interpret this in a harmful way (ie, that if ur a bully/abuser at any point, you'll forever be one).

for me, the point of this post is that things like bullying and abuse require systemic, broad action and intervention in order for us to change it. that if we do nothing, then abusive behaviour is rewarded more often than not: thus, not really giving a great deal of motivation to change. 

the comment of 'grow a heart of gold after teachable moment?' was less of a 'you'll never change' and more of a dig towards popular culture conceptions (in media and such) about how bullying is 'resolved'. bc they usually make it look *easy* but it isn't.
