<p>Black people, specifically slave-descent Black people in North America, are the racialized example of gender abolition, IMO. We are anti-human. We are the living embodiment of what it looks like to be without a true self or legitimacy within an oppressive structure. We have had our original culture erased and forgotten, and the future for us is as uncertain as it is unassigned. </p>
<p>Gender within a colonialist context is not legitimate on or in our bodies, because again we are not human, we are anti-human. I do agree with the framework that in spite of this truth, many Black people will appeal to the system at the expense of others (cisgender Black people trying to access power are those who I’m referencing). Whatever concept of what is human has been defined, we are the inverse and opposite. And yet this has not saved us. </p>
<p>On the contrary, the destruction and forced abandonment of our previous selves has led to and was simultaneous preceded by a new label and world order. This, of course, was not done with the goal of fixing <i>us</i>, but rather righting a great wrong in the order of the world.</p>
<p>With this history in mind, I question how a redo of abolition will help dismantle gendered oppression. What prevents it from reforming in another phase, or what indication do we have that what catalysts this isn’t the formation of a new oppressive system?</p>
<p>And again, from what I’ve read, the point is that it doesn’t, because the future is unplanned for and essentially unimportant when compared to the need to destroy gender. But if gender is destroyed, like previous cultures, how does that form a safe place for people to begin anew? What is the point of a call to change that doesn’t conceive of protections for people to take with them?</p>
