<p>suddenly feeling like I should start working on being a better writer. like. start editing before I post? </p>

<p>idk. I like just writing and then posting. but. if I’m going to be serious about treating this like a job, I should maybe start working on improving? </p>

<p>most of the writing things I see are mostly about fiction. how does one get better at writing nonfiction (other than practising since I write often ebough).</p>

<p>fwiw I love seeing your posts the way you’ve been posting them.  And if you wanted to, you could argue that you’re writing in a stream-of-consciousness style.</p>

this is funny to me bc i hate reading stream of consciousness writing....

my problem is that i'm just too impatient for editing these days.

(also it puts me to sleep)

i like the instant gratification of writing and posting immediately.
