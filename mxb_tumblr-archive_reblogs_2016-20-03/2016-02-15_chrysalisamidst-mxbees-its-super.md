<p>its super frustrating. i’ve been soooo excessively sleepy these past few days.</p>

<p>as soon as it is noon, i feel like i spend the rest of the day yawning and fighting off passing out.</p>

<p>i’m guessing this is probably why i haven’t been able to write as much.</p>

<p>i’ll start writing and then fall asleep in the middle of a post</p>

<p>get all confused and stuff it into my drafts.</p>

<p>This is me except music and poetry to a lesser extent. Ugh it’s like the bitter cold and the bitter brokeness I am experiencing is truly bittersweet</p>
