<blockquote>
<p>Dear Internet,</p>
<p>I haven’t written much about #teamharpy, if anything really, since the case was dismissed back in March 2015 here or over on my profesh site. I’ve barely spoken about it publicly. There was/is nothing really left to say other than the case was dismissed. That is that. <em>But</em> there are no gag orders in the dismissal to prevent nina and Italking about it anytime or place we wanted to. <em></em></p>
