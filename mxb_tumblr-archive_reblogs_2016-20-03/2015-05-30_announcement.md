<blockquote><p>I am a woman. I would like to exercise my right to freedom of speech and say in no uncertain terms I would feel at risk and unsafe in a unisex toilet. I do not want to share a bathroom with anyone with a penis. It is not wrong that I feel this way nor is it transphobic.</p></blockquote>

<p>actually it is transphobic. why do you think you get to decide what is and isnt transphobic. jw</p></blockquote>

<p>Because babe, it has nothing to do with whether it not a someone is trans or cis. Its purely about women feeling safe. And you don’t get to decide it’s wrong for a woman to express these concerns.</p></blockquote>

<p>youre transphobic. just an fyi for ya. youre a transmisogynist and i pray you never have a trans child.</p></blockquote>

<p>And infantilizing as hell.</p></blockquote>
