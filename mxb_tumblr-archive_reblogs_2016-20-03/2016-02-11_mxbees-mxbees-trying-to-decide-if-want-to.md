<p>i just checked the temperature and…</p>

<p>its -15</p>

<p>i don’t want to go on a 20 minute walk when its -15.</p>

<p>why is taking the bus so fucking exensive. :\</p>

i also don't understand why toronto doesn't have time-based transfers.

its technically Not Allowed for me to take the bus to the clinic for my shot then catch the train on the same fare

(my clinic is basically right were the train station is. so it'd be convenient to just take the bus, go to the clinic, then hop on the train.)
