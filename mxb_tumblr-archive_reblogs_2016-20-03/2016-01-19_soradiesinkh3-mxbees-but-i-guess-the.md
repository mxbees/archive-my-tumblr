<p>but i guess the question is:</p>

<p>is there a level of oppression (in this case disability)</p>

<p>so profound such that we can perceive the person as incapable of making ethical decisions? of moral reasoning? such that they are free from an expectation to be ethical?</p>

<p>i’m inclined to think ‘no’.</p>

<p>especially not when such arguments are literally what fuels the infantilization of disabled people and why many are not considered fully human enough to be agents capable of self-determination.</p>

<p>I cannot see a level of this without seeing a person who should be considered a self-determined adult.<br><br>Even my cousin, who is disabled enough to always be considered child-like knows when he does things that people don’t like and can stop them if he wants, and he only does them if he’s really, really fucking stressed out. (And thus, he never, ever does them to me!) Like. Even disabled ppl in certain categories have vague senses like this. But ppl want me to buy that there’s a “line” wherein you can be allowed to do everything else but not be expected to consider others fully human?<br><br>n a h.</p>

the next thing i want to write about this is how... if you are demanding that ppl treat you as fully human, moral obligation is part of the human experience.

so....
