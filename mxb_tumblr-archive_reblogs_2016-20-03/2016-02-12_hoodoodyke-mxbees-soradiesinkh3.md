<p>‘arguments are part of any relationship’ </p>

<p>no. they aren’t. </p>

<p>arguments are not a sign of true love. </p>

<p>a relationship isn’t more valid if you argue.</p>

<p>Would you say disagreements? <br><br>I’m wondering if we’re having a philosophical disagreement or if it’s an autistic disconnect due to describing things with different terms or merely around different contexts</p>

<p>I don’t think this means that arguments are a part of true love.<br><br>What it’s saying is that you shouldn’t WORRY if you have (reasonable amounts of arguments about things reasonable to argue about), because when you are two different people, you are highly likely to argue as two different people are wont to do.</p>

<p>i guess for me an argument distinguishes itself from a disagreement in how heated things get? like. an argument can include yelling or whatever.</p>

<p>idk. i guess you can disagree with someone, get upset with them, get annoyed, get frustrated, get angry, all that without it being an argument.</p>

<p>er… i guess another way that i’m looking at this is that many people basically equivocate between ‘argument’ and ‘fight’.</p>

<p>so if we make a clear distinction, then its really fighting i don’t think is (a necessary) part of a relationship, rather than arguments.</p>

<p>Ah. Then on that I agree- which is basically how Rook worded it.<br><br>I don’t think you need to fight to be in love or a relationship, and I find constant fights/rows extremely concerning.<br><br>That’s why I’m like “fight fair” etc. as in disagreements and discussions and not communicating with the intent to hurt someone, etc.<br><br>So yeah- we basically agree but are using different words.</p>

*nods*

and not even my words. i was quoting a book i was listening too.

and contextually, what the characters had is what i consider a fight, not an argument.

there was yelling. they said mean things to each other. etc.

:D
