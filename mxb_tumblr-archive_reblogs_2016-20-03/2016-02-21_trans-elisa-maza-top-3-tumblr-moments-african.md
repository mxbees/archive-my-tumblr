<p><p>Top 3 Tumblr Moments</p>
<ol><li>African Americans vs Continental Africans vs West Indians (Specifically Massa Taught You Well 2k12)</li>
<li>Riley Vs Tumblr Staff (AKA Tumblr was/is so poorly designed an influx of support tickets related to Riley getting suspended temporarily literally broke the website for an hour)</li>
<li>Black Tumblr Vs East Asian Tumblr (The Cold Discourse War)</li>
</ol></p>

i was *just* thinking of number three bc of this whole liang thing and all those fucking east asians who jumped on me for pointing out how they don't experience police violence like Black ppl.....
