<p>i don’t think i’ll ever stop being irritated and frustrated by ppl with mental illnesses who think that being mentally ill is a license to abuse.</p>

<p>someone writes “don’t tell ppl that if they leave u you’ll kill urself bc that’s manipulative”</p>

<p>invariably someone replies “sorry for being mentally ill”</p>

<p>i hope u realize that ur more damaging and harmful to mentally ill ppl than those who want to hold us accountable.</p>

<p>ur part of the reason ppl think that ppl with mental illnesses are dangerous.</p>

<p>thanks.</p>

but really.

these ppl basically confirm the stigma that we are all just potentially harmful abusers who'll drag our non-mentally ill loved ones down into our endless pits of despair and pain and suffering.

who the fuck is going to want to even try to have a relationship with us if their general expectation is that they might be told

'if u leave me i'll kill myself'

**I** wouldn't want to date a mentally ill person if i thought this would be something that would happen.
