<p>hey everybody, i hate to do this again but i really need to ask for some financial help. i just lost my wallet, it had all my cards and identification and $70 cash i was going to put in the bank in the morning. i’ve cancelled all my cards and am gonna have to replace my drivers license and ID which will probably be around 35 dollars each, not totally sure. i’ll be able to replace my debit and credit cards fairly easily but i don’t have much on there that i can use for anything. <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=RSFC5VJB4ABRE">if you are in any position to do so please donate to my paypal i would infinitely appreciate it.</a> anything helps me right now in this unfortunate situation. i’m a trans girl who’s currently seeking employment, and this is definitely a setback right now.</p>
