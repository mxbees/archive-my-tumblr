<p>I’m so bored with my nail polish colours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What colors would you like to have?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>idek anymore.</p>

<p>like. i use gel polish and…. i have all the colours i like from the brand i usually buy. so i’m like… what do.</p>

<p>in general, i think i’m just… ‘meh’ about my nails. for now it seems like growing them out isn’t really an option. which i actually don’t mind having them short, tbh.</p>

<p>but….</p>

<p>Ah, I was asking because I have a shitton of colors I never use and maybe I’d send you some when I had the funds if there was overlap between what I don’t see myself using and what you’d want.</p>

i honestly still think this is one of the things i've yet to get back. like. i'm medicated by i still have a lot of depression 'blahs' as far as things i used to enjoy go.

quite possibly, that's the real issue here.
