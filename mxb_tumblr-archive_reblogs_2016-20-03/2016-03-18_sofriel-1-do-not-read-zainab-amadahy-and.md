<blockquote><p>1) Do not read Zainab Amadahy and Bonita Lawrence’s “Indigenous Peoples and Black People in Canada” it will just make you mad</p><p>2) Land claims are such a problematic thing I don’t even know where to start I can’t even articulate it because I so get it as to why land claims but also there are so many problems</p></blockquote>

<p>god. i heard them talk about this in real life and I was definitely mad.</p>
