<p>i think one of the reasons why, after all these years, i still consume as much fiction as i do</p>

<p>(esp. the ~trashy~ genres or fic)</p>

<p>is bc i constantly find the way ppl behave in these books baffling and surprising.</p>

<p>like. do ppl actually act like this? do they behave like this?</p>

<p>i often hear about ‘identifying’ with characters but.</p>

<p>this isn’t really something i do. i can’t imagine myself as pretty much any of these ppl.</p>

<p>i can’t imagine myself having their life bc i just… could not. live. like. that.</p>

<p>can’t imagine myself in about 99% of the situations characters find themselves.</p>

<p>its all so strange.</p>

<p>For what genres? (What r trashy genres?) do u mean like these characters action’s are too out of pocket or more like, ‘this situation is too forced, what’s even going on right now?’</p>

i listen to a lot of romance, these days mm, but i've probably read hundreds of het romance too (thousands?) idk.

the tildas around it are what i like to think of as sarcasm marks. i think romance is a perfectly fine genre. not trashy at all. but this isn't popular opinion about it.

no... it isn't that i think the characters are too strained or unnatural. that's the thing. i pretty sure that this is how actual people do act, based on my conversations with them. and some of my own experiences with others.

the thing to note is that i'm autistic. in a lot of ways, i think novels and fiction helped me learn whatever rudimentary social skills i currently have. but also bc of autism, a large part of me just does not understand why allistic ppl behave as they do.

in terms of romance... this is probably why my first relationship started when i was 28.
