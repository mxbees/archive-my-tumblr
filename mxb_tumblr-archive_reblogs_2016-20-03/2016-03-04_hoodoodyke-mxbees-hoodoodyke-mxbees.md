<p>i’ve also decided to make a concerted effort to use ‘gay’ in reference to myself more frequently.</p>

<p>if only bc some ppl have decided that since i don’t use anglo words for my sexuality that this magically makes me straight.</p>

<p>i’m super gay. fyi. in case anyone didn’t actually know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I support this</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the amusing thing to me, i think is knowing that i don’t like using ‘gay’ bc my experiences within the (cis) gay community were pretty fucking awful. maybe traumatic even.</p>

<p>like. i have every right to use the word but i don’t like to.</p>

<p>i also know that (some) ppl make a lot of assumptions based on who i’m in a relationship with and what words i do or don’t use.</p>

<p>from ppl who claim to know better. but really don’t. who still think that fucking is praxis and whatever.</p></blockquote>

<p>Honestly semi same</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never been within The Community without being sexually assaulted and ignored (both, not or-for any strangers reading this conversation). That doesn&rsquo;t make me less of a dyke- as we talked about in private it does in part in form how considered and welcome I feel though. I have noticed that I tend to take the opposite stance from you and Rook- when I&rsquo;m excluded and erased and oppressed from something I belong to, I tend to take a stance of defiance and claim it harder. </p>

<p>Like ring the alarm, I&rsquo;ll be damned if you erase me from where I belong/ but I&rsquo;m here bitch. Usually that just looks like me loudly letting bitches know, not wanting to be in proximity to them, but I&rsquo;m here and I&rsquo;m alive and exist, bitch.</p></blockquote>

<p>*nods *</p><p>I see that. u think for me it really is just that I only use bakla in my head for my speciality stuff. like. beyond the negative associations,  gay just isn't a meaningful term for me. </p><p>but. I'm definitely agreeing with your last statement. bc I'll use it just to be petty and bc i can and bc fuck everyone. lol.</p>
