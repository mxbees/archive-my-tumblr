<blockquote>
<p>Person A is able bodied and suffers from bipolar. Their symptoms include rapid cycling and major depression that makes performing activities exhausting.</p>
<p>Person B also has bipolar, but in addition to that they have a chronic illness that confines them to a wheelchair.</p>
<p>Person A arrives for their appointment, and makes it up the narrow stairs to the office. They’re exhausted, and now they have to deal with talking to a stranger about how awful they feel, and when they get home, they’re not going to have the spoons to feed themselves. They’re not sure they’ll have the time or energy to pick up their new meds tomorrow.</p>
<p>Person B arrives for their appointment, travels two buildings down because that’s the only place that has a curb for wheelchairs, gets to the building, and finds the narrow stairs. They see there’s no elevator, and the only way they can get up is to crawl, which they can’t do, walk, which they also can’t do, or see if they can be carried up, which is humiliating in its own way. They call up to see if someone can help them. The secretary says they cannot carry them up, forcing them to have to cancel the appointment and not reschedule, as the practitioner only works out of that office.</p>
<p>Person B has to find someone else to treat them, they wasted their spoons, day, and a much-needed appointment to access meds, because the building was not accessible for them. </p>
<p>Does A have it easy? Uh, no, they’re both going through the same shitty medical industry, and A probably isn’t going to get their medication for a few days because of factors like their job, their spoons, and life happening. But B wasn’t even able to access the industry that day, because of a difference in physical and mental disabilities, and now they’ve got to start to searching process all over again, this time making sure building are accessible, and not having meds to manage these stresses.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All this to say that yeah, more often than not the division of disabilities is sus as hell, but in the case of whether or not able bodied mentally ill people can use slurs against physically disabled people who can’t walk? Naaaaah. </p>

<p>so i just took a shower and was thinking this over...<br/><br/>i guess for me, the key part of what you said is 'a slur against people who can't walk'<br/><br/>for me the important ting doesn't seem to be about mental vs physical, but about mobility.<br/><br/>like. when i look at the above. i'm like. okay. i'm not able bodied but i don't think i'm the sort of person who should be reclaiming this slur. whatever my physical disabilities are, they don't impact my mobility in the ways that matter.<br/><br/>for me, pointing out how this distinction is... bullshit is more about allowing room for the cases where a 'mental disability' impacts a person's mobility. or when a physical disability impacts a person's mental health (like, if someone with chronic pain were to tell me that the pain is making them crazy, i wouldn't think they are inappropriately reclaiming the word).</p>
