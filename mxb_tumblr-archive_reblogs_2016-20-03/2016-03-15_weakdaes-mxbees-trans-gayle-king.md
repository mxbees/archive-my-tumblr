<p>proposal for new umbrella term: NSA/NCA</p>
<p>Not Straight Aligned / Not Cis Aligned</p>
<p>the slash functions as an and/or and i think it gets the concept of the thing pretty well</p>

<p>I like this but when shortened to an acronym (acronym? is that the right word?) it might be confusing, at least until it takes off (if it takes off to the level of being as recognizable as “LGBTQ+”) just cuz those acronyms are also known to be other things</p>

<p>Probably a bad idea to use an acronym that’s already used for an imperialist state organization</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lmfao</p>

<p>It’s also the  abbreviation for No Strings Attached on certain apps and websites so… that’ll get awkward very quickly</p>

<p>Isn’t there already MOGII for this?? Anyway “umbrella terms” seem to always be ways to include straight/cis ppl into shit they don’t belong to, like the “A” in LGBTQA. That’s all I see this “alignment” being for</p>

but actually. i haven't actually thought deeply about this use of 'alignment' in these neo-acronyms.

why 'alignment'????

it almost makes it sound like ppl decide where they are aligned. 

it utterly erases the reality that these categories are a type of violence in and of themselves.

like. it isn't the case that i'm 'aligned' with trans but not aligned with cis.

its the case that i'm violently oppressed by transmisogyny. 

and that's the thing. people like me (and i'm talking about my ancestors in the philippines not generic 'trans women') have been violently oppressed by trans misogyny long before 'cis' and 'trans' were created. 

the words don't matter. what matters is the power and the oppression.

but of course... as i was asking earlier. 

who does it benefit to obscure this reality?

how are twoc helped by nsa/csa?

seems like it'd do fuck all to improve my life in general and my experiences in the csa/nsa 'community.
