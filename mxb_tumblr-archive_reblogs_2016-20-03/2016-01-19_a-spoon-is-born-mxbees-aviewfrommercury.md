<p>i always wonder if these ‘expecting everyone to live ethically is ableist’ ppl</p>

<p>really REALLY understand the implications of what they are asserting</p>

<p>do you know who our society generally thinks isn’t capable of ethical reasoning?</p>

<p>children. or animals.</p>

<p>one of the reasons why children have a different set of consequences for harmful actions is precisely bc we think that they are not quite capable of moral reasoning, such that they should be thought to be as accountable as an adult.</p>

<p>these ppl are literally saying that being disabled is similar to being a child. or an animal.</p>

<p>that, bc of disability, they can’t be held to the same levels of accountability as abled people.</p>

<p>idk about you, but this strikes me as more ableist.</p>

<p>if disabled ppl aren’t capable of ‘adult, able moral reasoning’ then we aren’t (and shouldn’t be allowed to be) entitled to the same rights and agency as abled ppl.</p>

<p>which… interestingly is literally the argument that has been used to discredit and discount the agency of disabled ppl for a long, long time.</p>

<p>go figure.</p>

<p>I think maybe it kinda depends on what you mean by “live ethically”? I mean like the difference between “don’t steal puppies from orphans” and “check literally every ingredient on everything you buy because if it contains sodiumhpyerflourochlorotrumpium then you’ll go to hell because the company that makes that chemical is owned by a guy once didn’t wash his hands after going to the toilet.”<br><br>Like, the difference “expecting people to know the difference between right and wrong is ableist” is bull, but “expecting people to have the time and money to meet sometimes-arbitrary standards and shaming them if they don’t is ableist” is a bit different (see: bad-veganism)</p>

<p><p>i really meant ‘live ethically’ in the most generic way possible. given that i’m a pluralist, i don’t really believe in pushing my personal ethical beliefs onto other people.</p>

<p>indeed, for myself, the kind of militant veganism you’re describing is unethical in and of itself for the exact reasons that you point out.</p>

<p>additionally, given that i’m a virtue ethicist, for me ‘living ethically’ involves simply <em>trying</em> to embody some kind of virtue. whether or not you perfectly succeed isn’t the point. the point is that you <em>try</em>. and ppl can decide whatever virtue they’d like to embody for themselves<sup id="fnref:p137618360569-virtue"><a href="#fn:p137618360569-virtue" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>i guess what i’m really saying here is that claiming that disability (or anything else) absolves you of ethical obligations is creates room for people to believe that they don’t even have to <em>try</em> to live ethically. like in any capacity whatsoever. it creates space for some ppl to claim that they cannot be held accountable bc of whatever reason they are trying to give. although, as i point out, there are mitigating circumstances that influence the level of accountability, i don’t think that anyone is entirely free of it.</p>

<p>and that’s the thing about ethics: they are necessarily normative. they have to be. posts like the one i’m talking about amount to complaining that ethics are normative. ‘its ableist to expect ethical behaviour’ = 'i don’t like that ethics are normative’. which… is an entirely different thing.</p>

<p>like. you want to argue that we should live in an amoral society (in the sense that we have no sense of normative ethics, not that there are no ethics of any kind)? argue for that. be clear that this is what you mean. or even be clear about the fact that you don’t think you should be held accountable for what you do and the harm that you cause. there is no shortage of people who are outright say this.</p>

<p>but couching this all in social justice language when your main issue is that ethics are normative, so people have expectations? fuck off.</p>

<p>i mean. given my recent writing about ideological purity and other… toxic elements of 'social justice communities’ and/or activism, i hope, overall, that people do get where i’m coming from with this. i absolutely do think that many people wield their personal ethical beliefs as a weapon against others. and that, overall, this generally creates a toxic, coercive environment where people care more about the performance and appearance of ethical behaviour, rather than allowing people the space to really and truly try to live ethically.</p>

<p>but. ethics are normative.</p>

<p>its literally the whole fucking point of them.</p>

<p>complaining about this is like complaining that water is wet.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr><ol><li id="fn:p137618360569-virtue">
<p>and even decide what counts as a virtue at all – within some normative constraints, though, since i don’t think anything and everything can be framed as a virtue but i’ll not get into this here bc this is part of my own normative ethical beliefs and not relevant to this discussion <a href="#fnref:p137618360569-virtue" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>

<p>As for me, I’ve seen tons of people invoke stereotypes like ‘disability=child-like’ when it is convenient for them. I mean, I just saw a post last night that was “expecting me to unlearn antiBlackness is ableist”. This is something I dealt with in my disability gaming group, too-”Oh, don’t yell at him for being frighteningly misogynist and racist, he’s disaaaabled” like, fuck you so am I???? So is EVERYONE here???? It’s just replicating oppressive power structures within an oppressed community.</p>

<p>This ^^ might be old hat talk for Teh Discourse, but I don’t have any idea what “ethics are normative” means. What I do know is that this is a very clear problem that I have had to mediate, not only a personal-meatspace environment, but a fucking PROFESSIONAL meatspace environment, for *years*. <br></p>

<p>I have seen many college-age (especially white) disabled people pull the “But I’m a precious disabled baby who doesn’t know what they’re saying” with me, when it’s convenient for them. So basically what I’m saying is that it’s sometimes not about them realizing what they might be <i>implying</i>, I’ve seen it deliberately invoked to dodge accountability or having to acknowledge they did anything wrong, much less *change* the harmful behavior. Or they stand back and look sad and let someone else do it for them. It’s a deliberate sort of self-infantilization, which I think a lot of us have seen before in other contexts. :|<br></p>

i have a follow up post about what 'ethics are normative' means.

in short:

ethics is about how people *should* behave. this is inherently normative because it puts constraints on indididual (and collective) behaviour.

in much the same way that 'heteronormativity' is the expectation that everyone *should* be heterosexual. 

ethics are always theories about what people should do in order to be good.
