<p>Its not for able bodied people to use i dont care if you think youre “crippled” by your mental illness, that word is not for you</p>

<p>Please spread this if you are able bodied</p>

<p>i mean... just because mental illness happens in your *brain* doesn't mean that there is a physical component, lol right?<br/><br/>nor should the fact that not everyone subscribes to a cartesian duality of the mind/body cause anyone pause.<br/><br/>i mean. the way white ppl conceptualize and view the body and mind is universal, right?</p>
