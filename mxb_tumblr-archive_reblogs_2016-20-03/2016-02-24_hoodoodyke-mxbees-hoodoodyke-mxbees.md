<p>I’d be more willing to engage in ace discourse if so many of them didn’t joyfully engage in so much horizontal aggression. </p>

<p>like. I want nothing to do with u ppl. </p>

<p>ur embarrassing. </p>

<p>this is why I dont generally bother to ID myself as ace. I don’t want ppl thinking I’m with u. bc i’m really not. </p>

<p>I don’t like u. u aren’t in my community. if only bc i’ve learned that I have no community. but mainly bc I’d rather be by myself than claim u.</p>

<p>What do you mean by horizontal aggression? You mean lgbt ace VS lgbt ace or like ace VS ace or?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>more like… lgbt ace vs gay. or whatever. like when aces are openly homophobic.</p>

<p>horizontal aggression isn’t my term and i’m not 100% committed to it bc i think it flattens actual hierarchies of oppression (or has been used this way anyway)</p>

<p>Mmm. I’m still confused. Slightly less so but I need a concrete scenario to understand this.<br><br>Do you mean like when an ace who could claim LGB and/or T talks about sex in terms of privilege while denying the hypersexuality put upon LGBT people?<br><br>I would say race being equal in that case- which it usually isn’t because it’s usually white aces doing this and implying this about PoC.</p>

yeah. 

like. i think a clear example is when aces call non-ace ppl 'sexuals' and over and over again poc (and gay ppl) criticize them bc this framing is shitty and oppressive.

and yet many of them persist in using 'sexual' to describe non-aces.

to me. that's horizontal aggression.
