<blockquote>
<p><p>the point I’m making is basically:</p>
<ol><li>“gender” as I’m using the term here (i.e. the modern Western conception of the gender binary) was <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fglobalstudies.trinity.duke.edu%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2Fcgsh%2Fmaterials%2FWKO%2Fv2d2_Lugones.pdf&amp;t=MzdlZTE0NTc2NzRjYWFmYWRiMGZjYjA3NDc3ZjI0YWVjNDRiNWIwYSxoVUhvUDhrVA%3D%3D">a colonial imposition </a>used to subject indigenous peoples / colonial subjects (obviously especially women) to European capitalist control<br></li>
<li>given that this gender binary is a white thing, the ways in which “nonbinary” identity is conceptualised are often tied into white (neo)liberalism (because they ultimately refer back to the European gender binary as the thing that they’re opposing, even while they ostensibly lie “outside” it)<br></li>
<li>thus the insistence on calling people of colour / indigenous peoples / colonial subjects “nonbinary” (or other similarly white identities under the nonbinary umbrella or w/e) <a href="http://gothhabiba.tumblr.com/post/137917883622/the-cistrans-binary-also-furthers-centralization" class="tumblr_blog">can be conceptualised as a continuation of the colonial project</a> that was the imposition of the European gender binary<br></li>
<li>so insisting that people of colour etc. call themselves trans or nonbinary in order for them to be “allowed” to talk about the gender binary in any way, or in order to name it as something that harms them, can be read as colonial</li>
<li>especially if you’re talking about women who are of colour / indigenous / colonial subjects etc., i.e. people whom the gender binary was quite literally designed to harm</li>
</ol></p>
