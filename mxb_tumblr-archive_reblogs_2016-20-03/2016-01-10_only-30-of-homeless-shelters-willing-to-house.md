<blockquote>
<p>They called 100 shelters in 4 states to see what kind of access trans women in these states had to homeless shelters.</p>

<p>Overall, only 30% would house trans women in gender appropriate facilities (ie, as women).</p>

<p>21% outright refused shelter.</p>

<p>This? Is why the public accommodations debate is so fucking important. Yes. Peeing and shitting matters a great deal. But trans women have been and will continue to use public restrooms when we must.</p>

<p>Homeless shelters, women’s shelters, rape crisis centres, etc, however? Are an entirely different story.</p>

<p>I’d love to see someone do a test like this with IPV/DV Women’s shelters and/or rape crisis ones. Having some actual figures and facts about trans women’s access to these spaces (rather than just - albeit important - anecdotes).</p>
