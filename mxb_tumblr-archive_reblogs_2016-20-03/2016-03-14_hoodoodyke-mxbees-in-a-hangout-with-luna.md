<p>in a hangout with luna yesterday, i had a hypothesis.</p>

<p>since i don’t like necessarily thinking that ppl are directly plagiarizing me (no reason why pple can’t, as i did, think up these things on their own)</p>

<p>some of the ideas that i’ve been sitting on for the past year or so, i’m just not going to write about. these are ideas that i haven’t shared bc i don’t feel like getting harassed over them.</p>

<p>but… we’ll see if anyone else starts talking about them in a couple of years. then i’ll know.</p>

<p>(although, in another way, this kind of makes me sad. bc i could – as i already have – make some contributions to various discourses. but the state of things today guarantees that i’d get harassed for saying some of the things i’m thinking. you know, like i used to (and, tbh, still do). i guess a large part of me is still exhausted and burned out from actively engaging that sort of thing.)</p>

<p>&lt;3<br><br>Is it possible for you to write them but keep them in a metaphorical safebox?</p>

maybe... or these could be the ones that i write and share privately... which isn't a bad idea.

these ideas have been bubbling in my head for a while and they really want to get out.
