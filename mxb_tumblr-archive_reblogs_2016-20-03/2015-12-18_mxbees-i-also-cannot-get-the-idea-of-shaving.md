<p>i also cannot get the idea of shaving my head out of my head.</p>

<p>i feel like this is a thing that must happen.</p>

<p>i could wear hats all the time again.</p>

<p>toques. hoodies. scarves.</p>

<p>of course my stealth stats would probably drop to like, -1.</p>

<p>maybe i’d have to go back to using the men’s restroom in public?</p>

<p>idk. its all weird.</p>

<p>still wanting to do this, btw.<br/><br/>can't tell if its because my self-destructiveness is coming out to play<br/><br/>or me just being lazy and tired of the maintanence that long hair requires.</p>
