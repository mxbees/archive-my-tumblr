<p>Antiblackness is relevant because your asses made it relevant the moment you decided to talk over black people and imply we were invading a space that literally exploits us.  Believe it or not, if you say incorrect things about another group then they are allowed to tell you your wrong and their responses aren’t less valid because they arent as convienient, especially when you barely skimmed over them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, the basis that danggeun was being antiblack by calling Alexandra black is pretty weak. </p>
<p>“why is there a black person in Rania” <i>in context with the rest of the post </i>clearly indicates that that racial description “black” could have been interchanged with white as well, since the point of the post was non-Korean people’s attitudes towards Korean culture as a trendy thing for them to be a part of because it’s attractive for them, disregarding that it’s a media form that doesn’t serve them.</p>
<p>And once again, I also find that the argument that racist appropriation of black culture is a space for entry by non-Korean black people is taking an entirely western perspective on Korean culture, not to mention if anything it exacerbates anti-blackness in kpop. A black-American was invited to an appropriative space, essentially authenticating the appropriation and thus she’s terribly exploited. </p>
<p>When you bring a black-American into KPOP she isn’t claiming the black culture in KPOP, she was brought into Rania to be a <i>participant </i> in it. </p>
<p>And in the mean-time, her existence in korean pop delegitimizes the identities of black-Koreans even further. </p>
<p>To elaborate: Why did Rania’s managers go out of their way to find a black-American foreigner instead of finding a black-Korean? Clearly, it wasn’t just the factor of her black race.</p>
<p>This is why discussions on Korea get messy if you aren’t aware of the dynamics of western influence in Korea. Essentially, “Americanness” is a concept that’s a symbol of modernity, of coolness and trendyness in Korea. Alexandra, being black-American, represents that. It’s not her just being black, since race isn’t perceived the same way in Korea as it is in America, it’s also her being <i>American.</i></p>
<p>to National Koreans, she’s an “authentic black-American person” in KPOP, wow!”</p>
<p>Black-Koreans on the other hand struggle with their identity because they’re not seen as Korean, and like Michelle Lee if they haven’t been to America or don’t really connect with their black identity which they are expected to, they end up being ostracized. </p>
<p>The treatment of Michelle Lee and Alexandra will <i>never </i>overlap. If anything, Alexandra has detracted from the struggles black-Koreans face by being what Koreans expect black-Koreans to be, regardless if they actually identify with being American or not. </p>
<p>Thus, this is definitely an issue of non-Korean people invading a Korean space, a space that has rejected black-Korean people.</p>
<p>Also, we can’t ignore the issue of appearance on top of American vs. Black-Korean identities:</p>
<p>As evident by the Korean netizens’ comments, Alexandra is held as the ideal exotic western beauty, some even going to say that she looks “latina”.</p>
<p>Michelle Lee on the other hand was bullied at school for having dark skin, for having “black” features. </p>
<p>So this is also a matter of Michelle Lee not looking attractive to Korean people, vs. Alexandra being an attractive black person,</p>
<p>although the factor that Alexandra has been a foreigner from the getgo and is treated as such by Korean people vs. Michelle Lee having her Korean identity invalidated is bigger. </p>

<p>I wish you would stop tryna tell us what is and isn’t anti blackness since you know you ain’t black.</p>

<p>I’m a non-black Korean, so I wish <i>you</i> would stop trying to diminish the impact that non-Koreans in KPOP have on Koreans, black-Koreans included, by making this about Alexandra’s black identity when the issue was on her being <i>non-Korean. </i></p>
<p>these two issues, antiblackness and non-Korean fetishization of Korea can be addressed on a <b><i>separate</i></b>, but equally important platform as anti-blackness, and I have been very frustrated with the former issue being diminished due to the anti-blackness perpetuated in KPOP and in other forms of Korean media.</p>
<p>If danggeun had put “why is there a non-Korean black person in Rania”, would that have made it less anti-black?</p>
<p>I’m starting to think no, since from your previous posts it’s not just that issue, it’s that she had an issue with a non-Korean black person in KPOP to begin with, and you correlated that with the anti-blackness in Korea, which <i>why </i>are you so quick to conflate a Korean person’s questioning a black person in KPOP with anti-black sentiments in kpop?</p>
<p>Is it because korean pop is anti-black, that a Korean person questioning “why is there a black person in KPOP” is a definite indicator of anti-blackness?</p>
<p>If anything, you’ve then played into the western hemisphere’s reduction of Asian countries, like Korea, into two-dimensional stereotypes, where its people are a monolith and absolute reflections of their media and whatever backwards values America likes to push. </p>
<p>I mean yeah I get it’s hard to realize your anti-Asian racism because it’s had a history of being so subtly pervasive, but come on, at least try.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I honestly wish the ‘Anti Black’ mob would just stop commenting/derailing and go back to ignoring us like usual (not to mention ignoring that <b>anti Asian racism exists and is real</b>) so we can police our own issues, I mean damn. I’m already exhausted seeing my fellow Asians repeat what is the real issue and have to bend over backwards to defend themselves from fucking baseless accusations of interminority racism. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You wanna talk about policing your own issues but want us black people to shut up about anti-blackness </p>
<p>Lol “Anti Black mob” just say niggers like you want to lol and mob? Lol nice word choice, equating the black people calling you guys out to a mob</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She clearly wanted to address a completely different issue and made a wrong word choice. I’m not trynna be the token black friend I’m just saying that a lot of y'all are completely taking this out of context..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“I’m not tryna be the token black friend but imma power thru it” </p>

wow. i can't believe this has all managed to get *worse*.

also, like, i'm guess i'm glad for the reminder why i also stay far far away from most other non-Black asians on tumblr bc this is our discourse apparently.

'here what the ~real~ issue is. the issue is that we used Blackness as a way to symbolize the foreign influence on kpop and how that's bad. which isn't anti-Black bc i say so. however, you're all being anti-Asian by invading korean spaces where we'll police our own issues by ensuring that we prop up virulent anti-Blackness'

is it really this hard to say, "hey, i'm sorry." especially *if* you were really using Blackness as a proxy for foreigness? it likely would've been much easier than a multiple day inter-racial blowout bc you want to double down on your anti-Blackness bc of reasons.
