<p>One of the things that people often do when they are young and in the process of discovering their individual creeds is grasp onto ideas that they do not fully understand.<img src="https://33.media.tumblr.com/d53f81997ea9ffaf2d7dfb96e277c68d/tumblr_inline_n6emhoyCBP1qfsy9b.png"></p>

<p>I make a lot of noise about some of these things, because even though I did the same damn thing, I went on to learn better and if I am lucky to gain a bit of wisdom along the way.</p>
<p>An example of this is the way I laugh when I see people talk about gender being a social construct but how sex is not a social construct.  I laugh because when someone does that, it serves as a tacit admission that they do not understand what social constructions are, and instead have been socialized to think they are something that they are not and so feel justified in making that statement.</p>
<p>Exciting, huh?  When you have the knowledge, it changes the way you perceive things – within the arguments that go on about how sex is a social construct (and, make no mistake, it is a social construct and those saying otherwise are wrong) there are a lot of things that happen that make perfect sense when the people doing those arguments do not understand what social constructs are.</p>

<p>That those arguing sex is a social construct are right doesn’t change that they are doing so without understanding what a social construct is – they are doing it because they accepted the socialization that it is such.</p>
<p>This is really only a shade better than those arguing it isn’t – in the end, the problem is not understanding what a social construct is.</p>
<p>For the meat and potatoes, you have to go below the fold for now…<img src="https://38.media.tumblr.com/9723101545133231e3080efba89ff73e/tumblr_inline_n6emj0hrpJ1qfsy9b.png"></p> <p><a href="http://tonidorsay.tumblr.com/post/87326238574/on-socialization-why-terfs-are-wrong" class="tmblr-truncated-link read_more">Keep reading</a></p>

if there's anything i truly enjoy, its being proved right. lol.

i am not a social scientist. i don't, in fact, have a great deal of education (or any really) in sociology and related fields. 

what i do know is logic and philosophy and intellectual history.

and yet... just a few years ago -- without doing any additional research -- i was able to come to the conclusion that there is just 'socialization' and no such thing as 'male' or 'female' socialization.

but how did i reach this conclusion without doing additional research?

well... by using an type of argument known as 'reductio ad absurdum' or, for math/logic, the inductive proof method. whereby you assume the truth of what you want to disprove and derive an absurdity/contradiction.

here's a different way to process the above, if it doesn't suit.

the basic notion, here, is that there is either only one kind of socialization or there are more than one.

radfems, by arguing that there exists dimorphic socialization admit into their ontology the assumption that there is more than one kind of socialization.

but. given how socialization works and what we understand of it, if we allow that there is dimorphic socialization (in other words, more than one kind), then there is no reason to suppose that there are more than two. indeed, we know that other factors, as much as gender, have an impact on socialization. factors including (but not limited to) race, ability, socio-economic status, geography, language, traditions, culture, ethnicity, etc and so on. 

thus.... if there is 'male' and 'female' socialization, we must as say that there is 'Black', 'yellow', 'brown', 'Indigenous', socializations. then there must be socializations for people born in america. but not just that, those born in the South or the Pacific Northwest. Or the East... But even that isn't fine grained enough, since Alabama isn't identical to Georgia, for example.

You see the problem here? As soon as we admit into our ontology the notion of more than one socialization, the number of them basically reaches infinity (or at least equal to the number of individuals on earth... so like 7 billion with the potential to be infinite). 

if each person's socialization is unique, then we can't generalize socialization *at all*, making statements like 'men are socialized to take up space, while women are socialized to make themselves smaller' incoherent and absurd, since any notion of a shared socialization within such an ontology is impossible.

either there is only socialization or there are socializations.

but since assuming the truth of socializations leads to an absurd conclusion, there must only be 'socialization'.

in another way, i'm also demonstrating a different point i like to make about pluralism. i've said many times there are many paths to the truth. this is one example. Toni gets there via one route and I get there via a different one.
