totally ok to reply

i went with the ordering of one of ppl on the team? 

who basically said that the intended order listed was what they'd want on a blue-ray release.

(i really fucking hope they put out a dvd of the entire thing, though)

at least now they are all numbered and there aren't any overlaps or repeated episodes.

it'll have to be good enough. lol. 

i can share the list i made if u want.
