<blockquote><p>i&#8217;m thinking of setting up a distinct tumblr for transcribing image-text-posts related to ferguson and stuff. like. i usually delete all non-original posts at the end of every month and i kind of think it is important to keep this stuff up. also. other people would be able to contribute too&#8230;</p>

<p>y/n?</p></blockquote>

<p>okay. i'm doing the thing<br/><br/>follow this tumblr if you need/require/want/etc transcriptions from images that contain text and are related to ferguson. <br/><br/>http://transcribe-ferguson.tumblr.com/<br/><br/>people are welcome to contribute. this idea was sort of born from a desire to support Black people with labour.<br/><br/>note: rules for an image to be put on the blog is that it actually has to be something written by a Black person. yes. this means that you have a to put a little effort to verify the source. <br/><br/>this is about amplifying Black voices on a Black tragedy. <br/><br/>no images will of Black people who've been harmed by violence will be posted without a cut and trigger warning.<br/><br/>you also will not see Darren Wilson's face anywhere on this blog. <br/><br/>appropriate trigger warnings will be applied where necessary (ie, "police violence", "graphic descriptions", and whatever else people suggest).<br/><br/>my hope is to make the content accessible and as safe as possible for Black people (given the topic). <br/><br/>i'm going to leave submissions open so people can put in links or images they'd like transcribed. </p>
