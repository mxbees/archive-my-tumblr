And well, let’s just say lucky for me I’m tired of being diagnosed with shit because that’s….yeah.</p><p>But anyhow, I’m feeling like this is a thing I have a handle on. A lot of the time when I try something new, I have to just *do* and be like, “is this something I already know how to do?*” I was suspecting the answer was yes, and I was not disappointed. I can already envision myself in six months and rereading the shit I’m doing now like “TERRIBLE!” That’s kind of a good feeling.</p><p>:) Thank you.</p><p>*And when the answer is “no” there may be a great deal of crying.

<p>I actually got this term from biyuti. We were talking and they said they experienced hypomania and I was like explain the difference between hypo and just mania, and then I was like OOOOOOOHH, that&#8217;s me.<br /><br />If I force myself to write, I usually get into it and feel really good about myself. Writing is my first language. Speaking sucked until I was like 19.<br /><br />My issue is always no motivation, or self doubt&#8230; Like I will go, no one will believe this. This is too unrealistic (even when writing fantasy). But let someone else say that and I&#8217;m like are YOU FUCKING BLIND THIS IS BRILLIANT&#8230; Issues<br /><br />and I have no idea what I actually meant to write you.</p></blockquote>

<p>i like how i got everyone with this...<br/><br/>but i can't actually get a psych to listen to me bc to them, the only mania is mania. hypomania? lol nope. <br/><br/>to them it seems like the only  bipolar that exists is type one.<br/><br/>nothing else. </p>
