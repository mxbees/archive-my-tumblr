<p>i think i know where part of the confusion is from. in this case, when i’m talking about ‘politics’ i really mean the legal system and legislation and such, not politics in the greater sense of the word.</p>

<p>this is absolutely awful and a terrible human being and perhaps one of the few ppl i happily wish would die.</p>

<p>but… she is a lawyer. and she does have a better grasp of laws and legislation than many of the trans activists i know.</p>

<p>that said…</p>

<p>given that the legal system is inherently violent… it isn’t really saying much.</p>

<p>like. aside for her directly violent rhetoric, i’ve seen some of her stuff and how she…. so very carefully talks about the legal issues regarding trans ppl.</p>

<p>this is actually one of the reasons why she’s so fucking terrifying. not only has she shown that she does know how to mobilize the legal system in order to bring its violence to bear upon her critics, but in a very practical sense, she knows where we are vulnerable – in terms of the actual legal and political system in which we exist.</p>

<p>her grasp of this stuff is why she’s dangerous but also why no one should simply dismiss her as a yet another transmisogynist radfem.</p>

<p>i’m generally of the opinion that knowing your enemy is a good thing. and… well, she clearly knows us (or at least the legal/political stuff).</p>

and honestly? its only bc i live with a lawyer whose been slowly teaching me about the law and whatever that i can actually grasp how her arguments are slightly different than average and why they are dangerous.

but also...

bc of this knowledge i know that all the effort ppl have been putting into mobilizing to work against the bathroom laws are... well, somewhat wasted bc the effort is better spent in other areas that render those laws moot.

(i'm also not trying to say that i respect or anything remotely close. but... she terrifies me. so, very much like a spider, i don't want her out of my sights.)
