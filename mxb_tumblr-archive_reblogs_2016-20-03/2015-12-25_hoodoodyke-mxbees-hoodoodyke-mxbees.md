<p>i have a new icon. devoted to my current aesthetic inspiration, tubbs.</p>

<p>I was scrolling down several times this day and went past because I didn’t notice it was you. :P</p>
</blockquote>
<p>lol<br><br>esp since this isn’t one of the four icons i tend to rotate through<br><br>but tubbs is an inspiration. :D</p>

<p>Yes, yes, once I noticed it was you I approved and felt it made sense.<br><br>It was also very confusing because normally your avatars tend towards the cool side of colors, and this is very warm.</p>

<p>i don't think i do get the whole 'cool' vs 'warm' tones<br/><br/>someone tried to explain it<br/><br/>(and i tried to understand bc apparently it matters for makeup)<br/><br/>but idgi. i only really find out if makeup looks good on me if i try it on.</p>
