apparently i'm the only one surprised about being impulsive. lol.

yeah. i know that shaving ur head isn't, ultimately a big idea (which is why it is very likely to actually happen). 

the thing that is only bothering me about all of this is the uncontrollable nature of it all... but also knowing that the fuel of this particular impulse is related to depression induced hopeless/despair.

as well as going back into time and really seeing, well, just how much my life has been impacted by various impulses. i used to think that i was a lot more... careful and deliberate? but... not so much.

by and large, the worst of my impulses are usually curbed by my anxiety. (as in, i don't recklessly overspend in a ruinous fashion bc i'm too anxious about being homeless or whatever).

as it stands, my bro has already accepted the reality that i'm about 90% certain to shave my head while he's away.
