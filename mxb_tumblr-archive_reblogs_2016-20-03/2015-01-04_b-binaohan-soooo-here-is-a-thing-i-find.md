<blockquote><p>soooo…</p>

<p>here is a thing i find interesting. i reblogged two posts by disabledqueerdyke today about Rita Hester.</p>

<p>one mentions that TDoR was created in response to her murder</p>

<p>and the other notes that we need to recognize that the Black community has a lot to do with knowledge of her life and death</p>

<p><em>one</em> of these posts has 200+ notes and the other? 28 (at this moment)</p>

<p>can u guess which one?</p>

<p>i hope all the ppl who’re reblogging one, but not the other recognize that their anti-Blackness is showing.</p>

<p>could u be more transparent?</p></blockquote>

a day later

and the one about tdor is almost 20k and the one about the role the Black community played in making sure she is remembered... at 300 or so.

i just. 

i feel like i could write a long 2k word post about anti-Blackness in teh ~trans~ community

but. i don't have the heart for it. 

but this is also why i def. don't want anything to do with teh ~trans~ community anymore.

just.

so.

transparent
