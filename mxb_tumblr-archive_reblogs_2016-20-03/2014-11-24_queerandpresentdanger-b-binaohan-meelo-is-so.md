<blockquote><p>meelo is so irritating. </p>

<p>i hate u</p>

<p>his misogyny really isnâ€™t cute.</p></blockquote>

<p>omg this is all i can think while watching the new episodes<br /><br />especially because like, sokka&#8217;s misogyny in a:tla seemed intentional and purposeful and the writers addressed it promptly and continuously??? but meelo&#8217;s is apparently just like, endearing and comedic relief??? <br /><br />nope fuck u meelo</p></blockquote>

<p>yeah. like... sokka (esp during the Keyoshi warrior thing) def. gets called out on his misogyny<br/><br/>but meelo is just.. yeah. 'cute' and so no one really cares. <br/><br/>like not even his sister's act like i remember of my big sister... like. literally no way she'd let me get away with that sort of thing as a kid.</p>
