<p>now i’m wondering about an application of the ‘spoon theory’ that goes beyond just your daily resources.</p>

<p>what if we have a lifetime supply of spoons.</p>

<p>that is distributed to us on a randomized daily basis.</p>

<p>like in the spoon theory, you can borrow future spoons to use today.</p>

<p>but the impact isn’t just a reduction of spoons for the following day, but a reduction of the amount of spoons you have for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>honest to god, this is what it feels like to me.</p>

<p>that i pushed myself through school and borrowed soooo many future spoons that what remains for the rest of my life pretty much guarantees that i’ll never be able to work at that (already reduced) capacity again.</p>

it honestly would explain why i'm way, way less functional right now than i was even five years ago. 

and maybe, yeah, i just burned myself out and perhaps i'll recover from that and be able to be more functional again... we'll see, i guess.

like the fact that i haven't been able to force myself to really look for (or get) a part-time food service job despite having the time and being poor is pretty telling.

it often feels like it takes everything i have to just keep me where i am. except where i am is far below the functionality i need to get through school

and yet...

i just can't get myself to do more. or better.
