<p>*idly wonders if all the rebellious body modders realize that the counter-culture nature is bc of the cultural iaopoc roots of body mods*</p>

<p>i’m just curious as to what this means, like…. do you mean it’s cultural appropriation? because europeans/basically everyone in the world has been doing body mods like tattoos for thousands of years.</p>
<p><em>"The oldest documented tattoos belong to Otzi the Iceman, whose preserved body was discovered in the Alps between Austria and Italy in 1991. He died around 3300 B.C., says Jablonski, but the practice of inserting pigment under the skin’s surface originated long before Otzi."</em></p>
<p><span>i don’t know much about piercing or other body mods but i know tattoos are far from a culturally exclusive thing as the japanese did it, a lot of asia did it, native americans have done it, and europeans have done it</span></p>
<p><span>so could you explain this better</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>cursory research into contemporary modern tattoo culture in the west is directly specifically appropriated from iaopoc cultures</p>
<p>see: sailor jerry &amp; ed hardy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>you raise a really good point and i hadn&#8217;t thought of those sorts of tattoos, so i can&#8217;t deny that. it still seems like sort of a broad statement though, as a lot of tattoos are also derivative of traditional european tattoos</p></blockquote>

this literally comes up _every single time_ i talk about the (modern) history of tattooing...

you don't have to look all that hard at the history of white/euro tattooing to find out that _all_ white traditions of tattooing died out bc of christianity

and then tattooing got _reintroduced_ into white culture via colonialism. like we actually have an _exact_ historical person who we know reintroduced tattooing to white ppl (captain cook). 

tattooing as a modern white cultural practice has its roots in white colonialism. 

end of story.

this isnt just about certain motifs. 

_without_ white colonialism and white supremacy, white ppl would not be getting tattoos today.
