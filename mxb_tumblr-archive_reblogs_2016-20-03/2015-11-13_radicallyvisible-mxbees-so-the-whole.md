<p>So. The whole bathroom thing is a huge topic again bc of what happened in Houston. And, sadly, I’m <em>still</em> seeing people reference the notion that there have been zero incidents of trans woman assaulting cis women in restrooms. Yes… most of the pieces I see from the US will say that there have been no incidents in the US.</p>

<p>But <a href="http://syx.pw/1OIf0y7">as I’ve pointed out</a>, there has been one in Canada. And this incident <em>has</em> been used to influence policy, as well as give radfems and other conservatives fuel for their bathroom panic.</p>

<p>While I get that the problem I raise in that post, the one of free loaders or bad actors, really isn’t an easy ethical problem to address, we are going to need to if we ever want to get past this state of panic.</p>

<p>It simply isn’t meaningful to keep asserting that there have been no incidents. Sure, there still haven’t been because Hambrook wasn’t actually a trans woman, but there is no difference to the opposition. Moreover, we cannot actually guarantee that there will be no incidents in the future. Insofar as we can truthfully assert that, up until now, there have been no incidents, this has no bearing on the future. Unless we are really trying to pretend that no trans woman has ever sexually assaulted anyone. Which. Um…. yeah.</p>

<p>Like. This is what so many people don’t get. Whether or not anything has happened is irrelevant, because it <em>could</em> happen in the future. This possibility is the source of the panic. And, yes, it is entirely irrational which is why aiming for ‘rational’ counter-arguments is largely pointless.</p>

<p>And, no, I still don’t have a solution for this. I’m still not sure there <em>is</em> a solution. But ignoring this problem will, at the very least, not make it go away. Failing to address this in <em>some</em> more substantive and relevant fashion will mean that we’ll keep losing on this ground.</p>

<p><p>To me, though, it seems like the answer is that cis women can and do sexually assault people too, and we* are allowed to use the bathroom appropriate to us despite the risk that one of us might assault someone in a bathroom. Holding women’s bathrooms hostage because of the possibility that, because trans women are human women, an individual trans woman might be a bad person is transphobic, because we don’t prevent cis women from using public bathrooms on the basis that a small number of them are or might be rapists. I guess trying to understand where TERFs are coming from so as to better counter their arguments is an admirable goal, but I’m not sure they can be reasoned with on this, because their reasoning is based on a bunch of false premises they won’t let go of.</p>

*not trying to assume anything about anyone else, just flagging that I am cis myself, so hardly an expert here.</p>

yeah. this post wasn't a suggestion for people to come up with rational counter-arguments, but really an inducement for trans ppl to find some *other* way to address this problem.

like. basically saying that trying to argue against trans bathroom panic by saying 'this hasn't happened' isn't meaningful nor will it ever actually be effective.

that in trying to tackle, especially in a popular media forum, this issue some other strategy should be thought of.

this could be anything from reframing the issue (eg the difference between pro-choice and pro-abortion), changing the topic (eg idk. something like 'why do you want women in men's prisons?'), turning the tables (eg, 'why aren't *you* interested in protecting women?'), or something. anything other than trying to reason with the irrational.
