<p>wait. someone made ‘skoliosexual’ as in ‘attracted to genderqueer and transsexual people’</p>

<p>um.</p>

<p>we already had a word for that</p>

<p>afaik it was invented specifically for attraction to nonbinary ppl, not trans ppl in general, bc attraction to binary trans ppl is explicitly covered under the existing sexual orientations (for everyone except transphobes lol).</p>

<p>and it was intended to be used by nonbinary, queer, and otherwise non-straight ppl, esp nonbinary ppl who are only attracted to fellow nonbinary ppl, rather than being used by creepy straights.</p>

<p>but i’m not 100% clued-up on it bc it seems to have fallen victim to those problems already and i don’t really know anyone who uses it. most ppl just say, eg, “attracted to non-men” or the usual clunky workarounds.</p>

these days? 

i actually think i prefer the clunky workarounds. bc they're accurate without everyone needing to remember a bunch of new words.

i guess this is better than what i was reading was explicating but...

meh.
