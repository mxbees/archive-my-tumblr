<p>and. how we have the most mundane dreams. </p>

<p>and yet…</p>

<p>they seem so out of reach.</p>

<p>I guess it’s mundane to wanna get rich to take care of your friends? lol. IDK, what are big dreams, anyway? Most of them seem to be about taking over the world or holding it hostage with over-priced cures, or something.</p>

<p>insert sad trombone noises here but seriously my biggest, wildest dream is that somehow magically, like maybe fairies or something idk, just makes all my health problems gone</p>
<p>even the mundane ones like my shitty vision and my cavities in my teeth and stuff just poof</p>
<p>my less ~crazy~ big dreams are like, being financially secure enough to actually considering owning a home rather than renting</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh geez, I never even thought about my health problems being gone lmao. Maybe in an AU&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>my god. at this point, I dream of getting a raise at work. getting benefits. </p><p>being able to buy some new clothes. shit like this. </p><p>really. really fucking mundane.</p>
