<p>Dang, I really wasn’t expecting my bingo card to blow up like that (almost 700 notes in less than 24 hours) but since it did I just want to say a couple of things.</p>
<p>There are no real rules in Trans Woman Bingo. There is no judge who is going to come look over your card and tell you if it’s right or wrong. Don’t worry about what you think a square is supposed to mean. If you feel like it fits you, you can fill it in. If it’s something you would totally buy if you could afford it, fill it in. If it doesn’t even actually fit you at all but you can make a terrible pun out of it, then absolutely fill it in!</p>
<p>This is nothing like a comprehensive list/chart of what it means to be a trans woman. It’s just a bunch of (mostly) harmless, goofy stereotypes based off of breastforce’s original post/things I’ve seen around tumblr/things about me. Don’t feel bad if you only hit three or four squares, it doesn’t make you any less trans. </p>
<p>If I were to actually make a comprehensive list (even a silly, tongue-in-cheek one) it would probably be hundreds of items long. That said, you should absolutely feel free to make your own Trans Woman Bingo cards. Make a tag for them even so we can all share. I don’t want anyone to feel left out just because I only had 24 squares to fill in. In fact, if people want to, they can send me more ideas and I can make another bingo card myself. </p>
<p>And for those who don’t follow me, I made it and I didn’t even get bingo. So again, don’t feel bad. It doesn’t mean you lost or that you’re less trans or anything like that. You’re perfect. </p>
<p>I would be really sad if this post only got like 4 notes and no one saw it, so if you wouldn’t mind reblogging it <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mO39sQgXk46zIJOS1oGri0g">@breastforce</a>, <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/maOJG66PCiUlsOMN8CdNvog">@punlich</a>, and anyone who follows me and reblogged the bingo post.</p>

i was one of the ppl exposed as Fake Trans Girl. but. like. it was a joke? i'm kind of sad that some might actually be taking this super seriously.

like. the bingo thing is fun because it had a bunch of fairly random non-essential traits. if anything it underscores the fact that there isn't anything (biologically) essential to being a trans woman. 

if ur a trans woman furry? ur valid.

if ur a trans woman with a 90s choker? ur valid.

if ur a trans woman who wants to be a robot? v a l i d.
