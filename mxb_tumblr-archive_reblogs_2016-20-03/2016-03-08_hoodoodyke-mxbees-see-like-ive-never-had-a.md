See like I’ve never had a problem oding on benedryl but that’s just my shit body building a tolerance </p>

<p>I’d usually stop and wait for my body to reset in a week or two at six benedryl and i think it was anywhere from for two eight melatonin</p>

hmm...

at the time i think i was averaging about 8-10 benedryls a day for like two months. 

i think the ODing would happen at 10+ or so. 

got to the point where i had to pre-count my pills for the day so that i would know exactly how many i was allowed to take that day.

:S
