<p>i don’t think ppl understand how much time it’ll take me to finally comb through my tumblr archives and migrate them all to one place.</p>

<p>i just picked 190. from the year 2012.</p>

<p>for 2012 there are 1671 posts to go through.</p>

<p>this is why i wish i’d been good at tagging since the beginning.</p>
