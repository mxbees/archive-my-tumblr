<p>just saw more on the germain greer ‘controversy’. and. its the same old thing. crusty old white radfem is a violent transmisogynist, ppl don’t like this so they decide that she shouldn’t give such and such lecture, the media explodes, and i have to read a million thinkpieces about why 'censorhip’ is bad and how its just her opinion etc and so on forever and ever.</p>

<p>first off, i want to make it clear that i don’t care about the whole no-platforming. i think students (and community members) have every right to decide whether or not they entertain hate speech. i’d be estatic if greer and all the other old white crusty radfems would just… fade into obscurity never to be heard of again.</p>

<p>the only thing that bugs me about the conversation that inevitably arises is that we shouldn’t restrict 'free’ speech or whatever the fuck.</p>

<p>first. this ignores the reality that pretty much every country in the world places restrictions on free speech. yes, even the US where this right is taken very very seriously.</p>

<p>second. depending on the jurisdiction one of the restrictions on free speech is that hate speech isn’t allowed. hate speech is usually interpreted as 'inciting ppl to violence’ (amongst other things).</p>

<p>this is honestly where  ppl on either side tend to miss each other.</p>

<p>if greer regularly engages in hate speech, then restricting her public speech is desirable.</p>

<p>if greer’s opinions are not hate speech, then restricting her public speech is a type of censorship.</p>

<p>do you see where the problem is? one group does consider her views as being inciteful for violence. some do not.</p>

<p>this is the real issue at hand, not free speech. free speech is a red herring that usually works, too.</p>

i ended up talking more about this on twitter...

part of what i'm saying here is that every petition i've seen frames the issue incorrectly. it almost always says something like

"such and such radfem has said and done transphobic things (more rarely, they'll also mention the violent anti-sex worker rhetoric too)."

you know why ppl on the left and the right and all in between end up writing thinkpieces about why this is wrong? beyond the fact that the entire political spectrum engages directly in violent transmisogynist rhetoric, its bc this doesn't qualify as hate speech (at least in the legal definition -- which is bullshit but besides the point atm). this is why ppl think that it is all about a bunch of college kids being over-sensitive and easily offended and not tolerant of different viewpoints.

the general values that most (at least white ppl in euro/na) place on 'free speech' and the 'market place of ideas' really does say that speech that is abhorrent is tolerable so long as it doens't incite (in an obvious and overt way) violence. and usually the threshold for this is much higher than what radfems typically do.

but that's the other other thing, since most ppl generally believe the same as radfems, they don't even find the speech abhorrent. so then they are left scratching their heads about why some college kids are too fucking sensitive.

and we'll continue to have a difficult time convincing a lot of ppl that radfem speech is violent. most ppl do not think speech, in and of itself, can be violence. most ppl do not think the sort of things radfems say about trans women and/or sex workers actually counts as negative, harmful, much less violent.

and it isn't that i think the no-platforming is wrong... or that i even care about the ways that it does alienate mainstream ppl (bc fuck them, they already hate me). 

i think the thing that gets me is that these things are always such localised actions. and rarely seem to actually understand why we are always on the loosing end.
