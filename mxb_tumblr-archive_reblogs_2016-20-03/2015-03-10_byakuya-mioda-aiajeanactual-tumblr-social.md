ugh. most of the items on this list are garbage. 

good points: the anti-Semitism, the reliance on emotional manipulation.

but the rest of it? garbage. 

great examole... if u see 'too much' stuff on depression and not enough shit about other mental disabilities, at what point do u take responsibility for not following the right ppl? i see plenty of stuff that isn't about depression. all the time. 

99.9% of callout culture critiques are anti-Black and this one is no different.

blaming ppl for being un/der educated. good job. if all u see is shallow analysis then, again, ur following the wrong ppl. what then marks a 'good' resource? shit off tumblr? something ur professor assigns to you? what? fuck off with this elitism. 

teens also don't get punished excessively. they get punished like anyone else. and this is the problem most ppl have with it. after seeing ppl rally around an abusive, stalking 17 year old just because she was 17 when she was being abusive and literally _stalking_ ppl for _years_ as if her age somehow ameliorates or excuses the harm she caused by her stalking and abuse. someone being 15 doesn't excuse or give them rights to treat me like sub-human garbage with no consequences. 

'us-centric' again, ur following the wrong ppl if this is true of u.
