<p>i’ve also decided to make a concerted effort to use ‘gay’ in reference to myself more frequently.</p>

<p>if only bc some ppl have decided that since i don’t use anglo words for my sexuality that this magically makes me straight.</p>

<p>i’m super gay. fyi. in case anyone didn’t actually know.</p>

<p>I support this</p>

the amusing thing to me, i think is knowing that i don't like using 'gay' bc my experiences within the (cis) gay community were pretty fucking awful. maybe traumatic even.

like. i have every right to use the word but i don't like to. 

i also know that (some) ppl make a lot of assumptions based on who i'm in a relationship with and what words i do or don't use. 

from ppl who claim to know better. but really don't. who still think that fucking is praxis and whatever.
