<p>I’ve been wanting to write something on my observations about ebegging and what seems to work best (at least for me). I’ll try to make this short…</p>

<ol><li>Don’t try to sell anything (I always get more money if I just beg).</li>
<li>Don’t over explain (if ur begging on tumblr keep it around 250 words and have a key phrase that can be tweeted – so less than 140 chars with the link included).</li>
<li>Give clear details about what you need and how much you need (see point 2).</li>
<li>Leave out any and all attempts at emotional manipulation (esp. the ‘if everyone who follows me donates $1…’. This will never happen. Ever. Don’t bother.)</li>
<li>Beg for small amounts more frequently (eg. ‘I need a $100 to pay my phone bill’ vs 'I need $1000 to pay rent’).</li>
<li>Stop apologizing for begging. This will also help you cut down on the length of your begging posts.</li>
<li>You’ll get most of your donations within the first day or so of begging. Plan accordingly.</li>
<li>Begging for specific reasons and amounts works much better than constantly begging (think about panhandlers… if you become too constant a presence, people will just start ignoring you).</li>
</ol><p><strong>What follows in the 'readmore’ is a discussion about ebegging and the ins and outs of it</strong></p> <p><a href="http://mxb.ca/post/138352853864/a-short-guide-for-successful-e-begging" class="tmblr-truncated-link read_more">Keep reading</a></p>

<p>Saving this to read later. Interesting to learn the term ebegging, I was not familiar with it as I’ve never been introduced to the word. Hm. (I’m high. Sorry.)</p>

i don't think many other ppl (than me) call it 'e-begging'. 

most ppl say 'crowdfunding' or 'fundraising'

which is nice and all, but in most cases where i'm doing this?

just a nice euphemism for begging for money.

i'm literally no different from a person who sits on the street and asks every passing stranger for spare change.

and i think its important (for me) to recognize this and call it what it is.
