<p>While I am so over the “love your body!” movement in body positivity, I think I’m just plain pissed about the “stop hating your body!” movement. Why? Why should I have to stop hating my body, let alone love it? For some people, their body is trying to kill them. For some people, their body keeps them a prisoner, where they’re in so much pain day in and day out that they cannot or can barely move to take care of themselves for the basic necessities without aid; where there isn’t a waking moment without pain, and even when they sleep they run the risk of being woken up by it.</p>
<p>Some of us have bodies that are not ugly to us, but rather something we resent. Something that keeps us from pursuing our dreams, something that everyone says if we just tried, we could do it. But we are trying, and our body will not only fail us, but it will sabotage us. Some of us resent our bodies. That doesn’t mean we think they’re unattractive, not sexy, not worthy of attention and admiration for their beauty. We just. Hate. Our bodies. What they do to us. What they take from us. What they steal from our loved ones: our time, our lives, our ability to do things without feeling like a burden, or self-conscious of stares of derision, disgust, or paternalistic pity.</p>
<p>So, find a new way to help people cope with their bodies. Just like the “healthy at any size” push alienates fat people who are unhealthy, but still deserve their humanity recognized, these “love/stop hating your body” affirmation movements/new pressures are alienating, unhelpful, and erasive to those it simply does not heal. This notion of “it’s all in how you view the world,” “it’s all in your mind,” etc is not only patronizing, it’s ableist. Guess what? I’m an optimist. I’m full of faith. I think I’m beautiful most of the time. And I hate my body. </p>
<p>And everything it takes from me. And I resent and at times despise anyone who tries to pressure me to feel otherwise. If you do this without consideration for those of us who are suffering with our bodies, you are not helping or healing, you are part of the greater problem. The problem where positivity culture becomes toxic to the point of being pressured and denied access to your own anger about your situations. People say anger is toxic, grudges and bitterness and resentment are toxic. </p>
<p>But sometimes they heal more than any generic positive mantra; sometimes they’re about recognizing you deserve better than what you’ve got, and getting that pain out to relieve pressure. And kindly fuck off to anyone who thinks that’s an excuse to abuse- you can be angry without abusing people. Far too often, specifically with Black women and femmes, our anger at being wronged and our defending ourselves is re-written into us being the bullies. Why? Because we finished what y'all started? Tuh. </p>
<p>Positivity movements breed a culture that is so afraid of acknowledging that even self-hatred can be cathartic and a catalyst for growth, or at least survivability, that it smothers a full and real part of humanity. Love heals, but you can’t heal if you can’t grow, and you can’t grow if you’re being told that hating your body is wrong, or something you should stop. That doesn’t help people in the now. Does it help you? Then go for it, but if you want any kind of “movement” or “community”- start thinking about those of us you’re pushing out for your own, often privileged feel-goods. <br></p>
