<p>Also, re: gender nihilism and definitions of gender….</p>
<p>the problem with ‘gender nihilism’ definitions of gender–by which I mean the definitions that they use–is that it raises more questions than answers.</p>
<ul><li>if gender is division of labor, is it necessarily oppressive?<br></li>
<li>if gender is division of labor, why are white women and Black women and women of color all the same gender?</li>
<li>if gender is division of labor, why does gender nihilism not take into account how gender is intersected with/transformed by disability?</li>
<li>if gender is only oppressive divisions of labor, what about people who experience their gender as a non-oppressive division of labor? are they automatically wrong about their gender?</li>
<li>if gender is capitalist, why isn’t ‘worker’ a gender?</li>
<li>if gender is individual experiences of oppression, why is ‘woman’ a gender? many people who all call themselves women experience different forms of and manifestations of oppression. </li>
<li>if gender is an intersection of multiple definitions, how can one ethically say that they must all be abolished?</li>
<li>how does the idea of ‘gender must be destroyed’ interact with the ideas of ‘my gender is sacred, my gender is healing, my gender is peace for me’? obviously, not well.</li>
<li>why would abolishing gender be good for people as a whole?</li>
</ul><p>and more. Like, the main problem I have is that it’s like trying to oversimplify fifty million different problems and also say that they are the same problem. It’s just not true and I think it’s a disingenuous and stupid analysis that’s not <i>useful.</i></p>
