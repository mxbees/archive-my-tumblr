<p>and thinking about Tala’s response…</p>

<p>dreams so mundane that it never even occurred to me to want to be less disabled. lol.</p>

<p>i just want life to be less unrelentingly hard all the fucking time.</p>

<p>I legit did not think that was an option. I don’t even daydream about being Cured tbh. Just that I’ll have medicine available on the days that I need to do something. I don’t even dream of using meds everyday, because of how my doctor punished me for it. 8)</p>

yeah. lol. 

basically, where i am right now as far as disibility goes? is pretty much what i imagine is 'as good as it gets'. maybe with added therapy. 

like. i just want to have meds to keep me stable and never have to leave the house again and i'll be fine. lol.
