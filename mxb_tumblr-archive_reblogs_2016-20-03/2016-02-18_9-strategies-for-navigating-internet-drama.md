<p>I was thinking earlier about, after years of being around, how I now manage Major Internet Drama and wanted to share some of my personal strategies for navigating these situations.</p>

<p>To some extent, calling this ‘internet drama’ trivializes the severity of some of the things I’ve witnessed, been a participant of, or even been a target of. More accurately, much of this is abuse, harassment, bullying, or something quite serious. This isn’t a trivial issue. However, I’m going to try and discuss my strategies without reference to specific events and from the perspective of when everything <em>starts</em>.</p>

<p>Whatever the situation is (and regardless of your personal involvement), when these things begin, its usually <em>very confusing</em>. Or it is for me, at least. Details tend to be vague and sketchy at the beginning; since the story usually unfolds over a period of time (sometimes hours and sometimes days, weeks, etc). Add to this the fact that as everything comes to light, there will be conflicting accounts, contradictory stories, accusations, denials, etc and so on. Sprinkle the emotionally coercive environments and communities many of us participate in on top and you’ll also be dealing with peer pressure to ‘pick a side’ or make some Public statement, bc silence is apparently the same as endorsing whoever is the popular 'bad guy’ of the situation.</p>

<p>Add on to it various mental/cognitive/etc disabilities and suddenly the situations are fraught with danger and can leave you reeling and panicking. At least this happens to me. For myself, I’ve mentioned before that I process information very slowly. Significantly slower than average. I also tend to be gullible, impressionable, and easily influenced overall. Combined… these two things have landed me in places I didn’t want to be and had me saying/doing things I didn’t feel good about.</p>

<p>This post is the principles I now use to make sure that when internet 'drama’ breaks out, I’m not triggered. I don’t have panic attacks. That my anxiety doesn’t get so bad that I can’t sleep at night. That I don’t end up making decisions or taking actions that I regret in hindsight.</p> <p><a href="http://mxb.ca/post/139550647989/9-strategies-for-navigating-internet-drama" class="tmblr-truncated-link read_more">Keep reading</a></p>
