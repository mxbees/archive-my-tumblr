not an old post...

but i just don't understand why they have to *reboot* it again.

like. just give us a fucking spiderman movie without the origin story and the rest of it.

bw all the cartoons, comics, and two recent reboots, we fucking know his story inside and out. 

have like five minutes of flashbacks if you really need it. 

but stop with the origin story already.
