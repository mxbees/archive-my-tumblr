<p>re: archiving tumblrs…</p>

<p>is this something ppl would just pay me to do for them?</p>

<p>like. if i offered to make a warc file for 5 dollars</p>

<p>would ppl just be willing to pay me, instead of trying to figure it out on their own?</p>

<p>Absolutely. I’ve thought for like a year now how I’d love to pay you to archive my shit when i eventually decide to delete.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'd do urs for free. </p><p>I'd even do extra work to help u clean up the data.</p>
