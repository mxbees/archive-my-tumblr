<blockquote><p>that said…</p>

<p>korra was such a fucking frustrating show</p>

<p>not necessarily bc it wasn’t as good as atla (it wasn’t)</p>

<p>but bc it had…</p>

<p>the potential to be SO MUCH better</p>

<p>i don’t like how the narrative treated korra (esp. in contrast with aang)</p>

<p>half the time i was watching i wanted to punch my monitor</p>

<p>overall, the writing was sloppy and unfocused.</p></blockquote>

<p>like why did all of korra's growth as a character have to come from her getting beat up over and over again?<br/><br/>(i'm not the first to make this observation)</p>
