<p>people who claim to be body positive, but then use that self proclaimed status as an excuse to then forcefully change their body, clearly are working at body posi 101</p>
<p>body posi LITE if you will lol</p>
<p>what you meant to say, is you believe in body autonomy, and being able to do whatever you want to your own body, which is fine, you do you</p>
<p>but being body posi means loving your body as is, not changing it to look like some ridiculous beauty standard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean <br>…… I can think of some other things that forcefully change your bodily appearance; tattoos, plastic surgery, dying your hair, getting hair extensions, contouring, tanning, acrylic nails for example.. By that logic if you dye your hair you’re not body positive either. Because you’re “forcefully changing your body” and not “loving it as is”  I mean if you were truly body positive you’d love your natural hair color and not bend to an unrealistic beauty norm to have an exciting or different hair color, yes? </p>
<p>Technically speaking of course. But I’m sure you have other reasons to dye your hair other than a ridiculous beauty standard and this is TOTALLY different from weight loss yes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>funny that i didn’t once mention weightloss, but you did? and colouring your hair is vastly different than cosmetic surgery. that you cannot differentiate the two is shocking and worrying. </p>
<p>also, since we’re talking under our breath instead of owning up to our words here<br></p>

<p>I have always kept an open mind and a willingness to be corrected when mistaken, or discuss issues for a greater knowledge on them. But ok there. </p>
<p>2. I literally wear make up/do my hair maybe once a week? twice on occasion? i also never said i don’t do those things? like ever? i’m talking about physically altering your body, not adding some black eyeliner. how are you not getting this?</p>
<p>it’s clear you’re only looking to trash talk in tags rather than discuss the differences; not to mention you’re thin and your blog is full of super thin white women who all conform to the beauty standards you mentioned, so we’re done. *block*</p>

<p>Can I extend this moment of rational thought to add that it might be worth looking at the difference between the levels of intervention required by each of these things, and the difference between modifying one’s body and adorning it? Dying hair, acrylic nails, hair extensions and tanning all require relatively low effort and do not attempt to actually change the size, shape, or composition of the body, which is an actual thing that is distinct from hair. Think bout it, you can remove all your hair and still have a body right? Same goes for eyeliner and acrylic nails. THEY ARE NOT YOUR BODY. This isn’t a black and white delineation of course, as it doesn’t hold up well for tanning, but a few minutes a few times a week sitting under some UV rays is still a low effort, low risk endeavour. Not only that, but it’s effects are not permanent.

There’s a reason things like piercings and tattoos are called body modification. I’m sure there are people on both sides of the debate about how these fit in with body positivity. I say they, yet again, don’t attempt to change the size, shape or composition of the body beyond minimally. I suppose splitting your tongue to get that sexy lizard look is a gray area, too. 

Going under the knife or making a significant and long term change to your lifestyle are reasonably considered more substantial interventions than any of the examples listed above. These can result in an increase or a decrease in the size and shape of a body, and therefore are well within the framework of the body positivity conversation. See how logical that is?! Exciting, I know. 

 Now personally, I’m pretty inclusive when it comes to my concepts of body positivity, feminism, and other things that affect women to a disproportionate extent, so I’m going to take a leap here and give an example of where the line gets more nuanced: Exercising makes me feel good. It clears my head and gives me energy. If I start exercising, I am not betraying my identity as a body positive person. I am not intentionally changing the size or appearance of my body (and in case you felt like arguing that temporarily augmenting my neurochemical makeup with endorphins counts as forcibly changing my body, that also would count as a temporary change requiring low intervention). I may acquire some muscles, or lose some weight. That’s not my intention, though, and it is not something I consider when assessing if my decision to exercise has achieved what I wanted it to. 

HOWEVER, and this is the point I believe <a class="tumblelog" href="http://tmblr.co/muPeKxHmV_PPW52NAaF8ehg">@pardonmewhileipanic</a> was originally making (before you came in and dumbed down this whole adventure), was that if I identified as being body positive, and then went on a diet with the intention of losing weight (because being body positive means doing positive things for your body like losing weight! Right?) then I’d need a little lesson in Body Positivity 101, because attaching a morality to health, weight loss, body size, and body shape is completely incompatible with the body positivity ideals.

There are plenty of people out there who think that approaching weight loss or plastic surgery with a health-centred mindset versus a self-loathing one is the only difference between being body positive and not. Those folks should enrol in Professor Jackie’s course as soon as she gets it up and running :)</p>

<p>Hm.<br><br>I don’t know. I think a lot of these lines seem kind of arbitrary. You can be body positive and exercise to lose weight/strengthen your body because it’s medically necessary. And acrylic nails fuck up your nails for many months in the attempt to access a femininity ideal. I also feel like this can be shaming for people whose body modification includes things like breast implants… are those ok for trans women but not for cis women? <br><br>I think it’s really important to remember we’re under a white supremacist capitalist patriarchy and therefore body positivity is something that is a fluid and evolving thing for each person. What may be harmful for one person may be really useful and part of their self love process. Can we not have space for those people? Because that seems problematic, too. I prefer to think body positivity has different approaches. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do people need to vet their surgery details with you to qualify as being “body positive” enough? Are people who are dysphoric for whatever reason not “body positive”? Area we going to say “I’m body positive, but only ‘all-natural’ bodies, because clearly the only reason you’d have surgery is that you hate yourself”? And so what if they 'hate themselves’ - can’t they also try to join in body positivity efforts, to be body-positive for others, while they work on their own?<br><br>This isn’t body-positivity, this is body-shaming using some kind of social justice veneer.</p>

here's a great example of how/why 'body positivity' is a garbage idea.

like. as a trans person, being told that i'm only ~body positive~ if i love my body as it is.... fuck u.

as a disabled person, being told that i'm only ~body positive~ if i love my body as it is.... fuck u.

etc and so on.
