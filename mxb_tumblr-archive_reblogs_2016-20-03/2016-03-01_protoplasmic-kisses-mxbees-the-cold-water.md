<p>the cold water tap in my kitchen is very Bad at its job.</p>

<p>as the water runs, it gets progressively warmer.</p>

<p>to the point that today it was steaming.</p>

<p>water. from the cold tap. <em>steaming</em>.</p>

<p>the taps in my kitchen are actually reversed and the cold is where the hot is supposed to be and vice versa. Iâ€™ve lived here for a year and it still fucks me up</p>
