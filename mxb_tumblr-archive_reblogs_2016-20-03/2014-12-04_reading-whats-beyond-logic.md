<p>Unfortunately “white logic, quantifiers, and domain mistakes” was completely inaccessible to me, as I could not follow or understand the shorthand (there was Wx, where I could not really parse the sentence; and then there were other symbols that were not named in plain terms: ~, ∃, and ∀). </p>

<p>The ~ means “not [somethingsomething]”. The backwards E is “There exists at least one [somethingsomething] such that [somethingsomething] is true.” And the upside down A means “For all [somethingsomething], a certain thing is true.”</p>

okay. first paragraph is saying

"in inductive logic, it isn't inconsistent to say that 'white people don't understand logic' and 'this individual white person understands logic'. because in scientific reasoning, one counter example to a claim doesn't necessarily invalidate the claim. so you can say 'crows are black' but if you encounter an albino crow, the existence of the albino crow doesn't make 'crows are black' a false claim, since it is a generalization and not a universal statement.

second paragraph says:

a lot of people counter 'white ppl don't understand logic' with 'not all white ppl don't understand logic' (or 'some white ppl understand logic'). but this argument relies on the false assumption that

'all white ppl don't understand logic' and 'white ppl don't understand logic', which aren't the same claims (because of the quantifier 'all')

and statements like 'all white people don't understand logic' ('all crows are black') are universal statements, not generalizations. universal statement belong in deductive logic... not inductive, which is what was originally being discussed.

next:

basically saying that, in deductive logic, "all white people don't understand logic" and "this white person understands logic" is a contradiction. but only for white ppl...

i'm not sure if this helps... lol
