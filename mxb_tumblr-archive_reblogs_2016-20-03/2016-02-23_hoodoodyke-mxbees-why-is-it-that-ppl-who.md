<p>why is it that ppl who always defend theory being dense and inaccessible</p>

<p>always seem to forget that isnâ€™t always just about education and class?</p>

<p>like. u do get that there are ppl with, um, disabilities right?</p>

<p>disabilities that absolutely do render academic wank inaccessible?</p>

<p>but u just want to be smug and look smart.</p>

<p>It was so weird to me<br>Seeing self proclaimed radicals <br>Not just defending but adamantly proclaiming that theory MUST be inaccessible <br>Because they spent so much time getting their degree and paying for exclusionary education</p>
