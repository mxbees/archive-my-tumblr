<p>i’ve been begging for help on tumblr all last week and was just barely able to cover my rent thanks to everyone’s generosity. last night my car got towed from the parking lot at my apartment complex despite me having a parking permit. i’ve been arguing with them all morning but i still have to pay $193 to get my car out of the tow lot. <a href="http://paypal.me/morgansurvival">please help me</a>. i’m so tired of having to ask for help this way and i’m sorry to keep doing it but i wouldn’t if i didn’t really need support. if you have a job please send me $10. i’ll post the tow receipt as soon as i have it and will update as i get funds. thank you for helping me survive. <a href="http://paypal.me/morgansurvival">Donate here</a> or send to morgan.collado@gmail.com.<br></p>
