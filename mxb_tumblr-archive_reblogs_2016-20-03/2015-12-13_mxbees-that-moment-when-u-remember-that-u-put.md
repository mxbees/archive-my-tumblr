<p>that moment when u remember that u put make up on and u need to wash ur face…</p>

<p>but don’t really have the motivation or energy.</p>

<p>why did i make such poor life choices?</p>

<p>(answer: bc i had to go in public today and didn’t feel like dealing with constant misgendering)</p>

<p>this is also why i try to make sure that i wash my face as soon as i get home....<br/><br/>bc 'later' is usually a time that never comes for me.</p>
