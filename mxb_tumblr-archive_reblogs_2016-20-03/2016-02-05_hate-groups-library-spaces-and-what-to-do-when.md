title: Hate Groups, Library Spaces, and What to Do When They Meet

<blockquote>
<p>As you’ve likely noticed, notorious asshole Roosh V and his pitiful band of headline-grabbing attention trolls (who grandiosely refer to themselves as the “Return of Kings Movement”) have been publicising a number of planned appearances in Canadian public spaces. There’s no sense wasting effort on discussing the group (since they’re self-evidently insignificant and ultimately serve mostly to disctract from the real, difficult discussions about misogyny we need to have) but since they’ve planned to use library spaces for some of their rallies we have a bit of space to talk about how libraries can and should deal with hate groups who take advantage of their public space policies — which are usually, as they should be, very liberal.</p>
<p>Emotions get really heated around this sort of thing. In many cases, especially where an issue is making headlines, your community can and should be looking to you for some clear reassurance that a hate group’s values do not align with that of the library. If that’s not forthcoming, you run a real risk of coming down on the wrong side of the “RTs do not equal endorsements” line.</p>
<p>I know that we, as library staff, might take it for granted that our values do not align with those of hate groups. I know that we might feel our obvious inclusiveness and support of diversity in our communities might be expected to confer some benefit of the doubt in the public’s mind when issues like this arise. I know that we might expect our patrons to be fair-minded and reasonable in understanding that use of a library’s space does not connote the endorsement of its agenda by the library.</p>
<p>Guess what? Nobody outside the library gives a shit about any of that. When a hate group wants to make use of a library space, your community expects and deserves an assurance that you value their safety.</p>
<p>Rather than viewing that as an imposition, think of it this way. You are being presented with a golden opportunity to walk the right line between defending the intellectual freedom and right to free expression of all library users, on one hand, and taking an unequivocal stance against hatred on the other. Everybody gets to win.</p>
<p>Getting the messaging right is very simple. First, don’t do <a href="http://www.vpl.ca/news/details/vpl_statement_Feb22016">this</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">

<p>Instead, make sure your messaging incorporates three incredibly simple points:</p>
<p><b>1 ) OUR PUBLIC SPACES ARE OPEN TO ALL.</b></p>
<p><b>2) THIS GROUP’S MESSAGE IS ABHORRENT; WE CONDEMN IT.</b></p>
<p><b>3) PROTESTERS ARE ALSO WELCOME IN OUR SPACE. WE MIGHT EVEN JOIN YOU.</b><br></p>
<p>That’s really all there is to it. Get it right.</p>

It's incredible just how *wrong* this is. Lol. Especially in the Canadian context. But also in terms of alleged librarian values.

Hate speech isn't protected 'free speech'. Canadian law is pretty clear about this. Libraries have zero obligation, professionally or morally, to give space and venue to hate groups and hate speech. In fact, speaking within just the Canadian context, we have an obligation to *not* give space and venue to hate groups and hate speech.

Why? This sort of this is actually [against the law][hate]. The point being: hate groups have zero entitlement to public spaces, particularly ones funded by the state (which is the case with most libraries in canada).

It's true that the legal tests for hate propaganda are pretty high and it's quite possible that this group wouldn't have qualified (nor the other hate groups libraries give space too). But this one of the areas where libraries usual statements about these things re: 'that we'll follow the law' rings pretty hollow. 

But this post and most librarians views on this is exactly why libraries are an institution of oppression, not spaces that promote freedom of any kind.

The fact that you can seriously sit there and talk about how maintaining some high minded principles actually matters more than the actual safety of the targetted group is exactly why libraries are garbage.

Same too with the notion that you, as a man, think that this group is 'insignificant', because you're wrong. More to the point, given that this profession is 80% women, I find it interesting that you also appear not to care about the safety of the staff, many of whom are the targets of this group's hate.

That you can't really see a problem or signfigance in having a group of men gather in a space that mainly employs women who think they ought to be allowed to legally rape those same women is one of the best examples of bullshit Proggressive Man mansplaining. 

But what do you care? I mean. Obviously, this is all easy for you to say, given that you aren't a target.
