<p>IDK, I see a lot of abuse discourse on my dash, but I don’t recall too many talking specifically about how hard it is to recognize when it happens to you. In depth, that is. I see anecdotes often enough when it comes around.</p>
<p>The ones I see along that line are usually lists on “signs of abuse” or “how to talk to a friend that you think they’re being abused” but never like common ground “phases of realizing you’ve been abused”- especially for those that don’t involve physical abuse.</p>

<p>as someone who needed a lot of time to realize the depth of the abuse i was subjected to, this sounds really useful. </p>

<p>Yeah… I’m in no position to write it tho.</p>

<p>i might try to write something about this, since i was literally 28/29 before i was able to contextualize my childhood as being neglectful and abusive.<br/><br/>and there is so much stuff in my life that i still haven't even started trying to process.</p>
