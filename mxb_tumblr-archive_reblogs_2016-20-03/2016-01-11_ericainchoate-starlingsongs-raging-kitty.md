<p>here’s an example of an opinion i don’t think tumblr would find palettable:</p>
<p>transgender community doesn’t exist</p>
</blockquote>
<p>then what the fuck am i? a melon?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i have no idea what the fuck you are i’m pretty sure we’ve never spoken…?</p>

<p>I can’t speak to the melon part, but there is definitely “transgender community” if you’re white, skinny, abled (or have a disability ableds are okay with, all three of them), middle-class or grew up that way, live in the “right” part of town, and have the social privilege to be super-out. Oh and you gotta either work in tech, work in a non-profit being a professional trans person, or be independently wealthy. </p>
<p>One token non-white person who is lighter than a paper bag is allowed per city per community. No more than one, and no nappy hair please. </p>

er...

i've been saying this literally for years? like. tumblr doesn't care. i literally have a 5000 word essay about this. my work on this has been plagiarised and published in a Major Magazine.
