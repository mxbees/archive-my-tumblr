<p>more examples for why ace discourse is the worst and why i refuse to align myself with that community.</p>

<p>like. just n o.</p>

<p>i rebuke thee.</p>

<p>doesn’t matter that i’m technically ace. that my bro is technically ace. and that we are having a super awesome ace-style relationship.</p>

<p>i could be the fucking poster child for Healthy Asexuality if i really wanted.</p>

<p>but i hate white aces too much to bother.</p>

<p>sometimes i think about writing about my experiences of accidentally getting into a monogamous ace relationship…</p>

<p>and how we navigated that and whatever.</p>

<p>but meh. i like to keep some parts of my private life private.</p>

<p>Mhm<br>Part of me wants a petty princex ace term</p>

hrm. there's this.

in some ways... i consider 'gay' and 'queer' to be somewhat petty terms for me to use, given how often i see some aces whining about their inability to use either.

:D

but. yeah. 

we need something petty and spiteful. lol
