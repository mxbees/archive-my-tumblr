<blockquote><p>Why is it that when I gripe about games people tend to take it to mean that I hate that game and it sucks</p><p>The amount I gripe about a game is directly proportional to how much I like a game.</p><p>If I didn’t like it I wouldn’t have bothered to finish it or put 100 hours into it don’t you think.<br/></p></blockquote>

<p>this thing where if u critique a thing you Must Hate It. otherwise you'd love it unconditionally.</p>
