<p>although. the delay in satisfying my impulse</p>

<p>has made me realize that i could probably do the shaved head + bangs look</p>

<p>(a chelsea?)</p>

<p>best of both worlds. since i only code as cis if my hair is in my face.</p>

<p>but then i can be low maintenance otherwise.</p>

<p>so this isn't going to happen.<br/><br/>not when this cut is so closely tied to skinhead culture.<br/><br/>i mean. i've had friends who've done this without knowing the history. but now that i know, i cant unknow and i refuse to sport a style that could remotely identify me as a skinhead.<br/><br/>refuse.<br/><br/>i'd rather be misgendered 24/7.</p>
