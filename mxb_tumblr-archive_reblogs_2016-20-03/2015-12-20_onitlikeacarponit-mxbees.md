<p>although. the delay in satisfying my impulse</p>

<p>has made me realize that i could probably do the shaved head + bangs look</p>

<p>(a chelsea?)</p>

<p>best of both worlds. since i only code as cis if my hair is in my face.</p>

<p>but then i can be low maintenance otherwise.</p>

<p>so this isn’t going to happen.<br><br>not when this cut is so closely tied to skinhead culture.<br><br>i mean. i’ve had friends who’ve done this without knowing the history. but now that i know, i cant unknow and i refuse to sport a style that could remotely identify me as a skinhead.<br><br>refuse.<br><br>i’d rather be misgendered 24/7.</p>

<p>what if you do an undercut? Or shave on all sides except the top. I never knew about the chelsea, but a lot black women do that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>yeah! i’m googling various styles and seeing a bunch of other ones i can do.</p>

<p>it looks like the chelsea really is all shaved except bangs with two longer pieces on each side (or just bangs).</p>

<p>i’m thinking of aiming for something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/99/c9/fe/99c9fe8fb2b8ece92f3d935d34877528.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="http://pretty-hairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/shaved-hairstyles-for-women-11.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>since both are great and sort of what i want</p>

<p>(mostly short and easy to maintain but still femme)</p>

<p>I think these would really compliment your face shape and if you wanted (this is something my aunt normally did with braids) you could wear a bun on top of your head behind the bangs!</p>
</blockquote>

thanks!

these styles are basically what i have now (sidecut with long sideswept bangs or whatever) just, you know, shorter at the back and shaved all around.

i think i'm going to only leave the bang/front area long

bc i'm mainly aiming to get a cute style that i can wear hats with all the time, so no bun necessary.

ok. thank you for the feedback!
