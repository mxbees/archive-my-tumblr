<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday I spent the day watching my grandmother die. She
was taken to the hospital Friday evening, showing signs of what everyone
thought was improvement on Monday, and then only alive via machines the next
morning. She had had a heart attack, her kidneys were failing, and as a result
of a previous surgery, her bowels had been destroyed.<br></p>
<p>The doctors told the elders of my family, that my
grandmother was in great pain. With myself and many of my family members gathered
around, her oxygen, blood pressure meds, and the dialysis machine were all shit
off. In about five minutes she was gone.</p>
<p>When my aunts realized my grandmother was about to pass they
started to go through her things in order to recover her life insurance policy.
They discovered, however, that she didn’t have one. </p>
<p>My family has been going through a lot of hardships since December.
In addition to me being kicked out, and my mother and sister trying to leave my
abusive father, my uncle (the very one my grandmother lived with) fell off a
ladder destroying his pelvis bone, and breaking his arm.</p>
<p>We don’t have the money to pay for everything. One aunt has
purchased the casket, another uncle has purchased the headstone, plot, and
provided the money to rent a hall. My mother estimates that we still need
around $3000 to cover the funeral and digging of the grave.</p>
<p>I don’t expect to be able to reach this goal here, but I
would greatly appreciate it if you all could help me out again. We have until
next Tuesday or Wednesday to gather as much as we can. </p>
<p>If you can donate please send money to my paypal, the email
address is <a href="mailto:cinginrevlushon@hotmail.com">cinginrevlushon@hotmail.com</a>.
If you can’t donate, please, please boost.</p>
<p>It seems like lately y’all only hear from me when I need
help, and I’m sorry about that. I’ve been having a shit time to say the least.</p>
