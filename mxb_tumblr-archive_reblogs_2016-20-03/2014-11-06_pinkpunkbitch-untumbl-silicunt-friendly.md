<p>Friendly reminder that estrogen doesn’t change your voice so please do not make fun of trans women with non-cis sounding voices vocal training is hard thank you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is no joke. So hard. Especially if you’re older.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Support trans woman who chose not to undertake voice training. Support trans woman with non-cis sounding vocal resonance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes....<br/><br/>but<br/><br/>also<br/><br/>can we also just recognize that whatever voice a trans woman has, is a woman's voice?<br/><br/>like, this is all well an good, but the femininity of my voice isn't determined by some cis measuring stick.<br/></p>
