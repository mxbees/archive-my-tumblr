<p>also curious if any of the asians claiming that Black ppl are silencing us or erasing us or whatever the fuck</p>

<p>are going to give Viola Davis any credit.</p>

<p>literally every single time i’ve seen her talking about diversity in hollywood, she uses ‘women of colour’.</p>

<p>she could just talk about Black women. but she is including us in her advocacy.</p>

<p>has anyone but me noticed?</p>

<p>No- because first off she’s just doing what she’s supposed to be doing as far as they’re concerned- if she’s not singling out Blackness then they really don’t care- why praise something they think she’s owing them anyway?</p>

basically. and she's not the only prominent Black woman who uses inclusive language in her advocacy. she's just fresh on my mind bc i saw a gifset earlier with her doing exactly this.

but since we feel entitled to the labour of Black women, why bother recognize her for being really brave about her advocacy, since its quite possible her career will suffer for it.
