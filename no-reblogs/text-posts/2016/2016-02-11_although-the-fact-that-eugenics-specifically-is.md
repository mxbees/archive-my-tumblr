although... the fact that eugenics specifically is something that gets to me

isn't all that surprising.

given that my research into scientific racism stalled on eugenics.

bc i'm trying to get my mental and emotional resources ready to read the lecture? book? whatever

by francis galton where he coins the term and pretty much lays out the ideology.
