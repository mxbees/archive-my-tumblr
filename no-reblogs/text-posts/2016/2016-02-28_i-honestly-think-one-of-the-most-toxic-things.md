i honestly think one of the most toxic things about 'safe spaces' or activist space

is the fact that very few leave space for disagreement and don't have any actual method for navigating conflicts.

when ur in one of these spaces, ur expected to sit there and pretend like you like everyone. 

thinking about this....

i think part of the problem is that so many mainstream notions of etiquette and comportment are brought into these spaces. spaces where they are ill suited. but then there are some attempts to challenge or change these received behaviours but they aren't consistently applied nor is the attempt complete enough.

so we end up with these weird hybrid systems of etiquette that contradict each other.

at least i'm guessing this is why my autism just can't function in these spaces.
