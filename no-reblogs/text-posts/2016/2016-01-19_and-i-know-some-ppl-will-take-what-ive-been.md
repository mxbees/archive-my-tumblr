and i know some ppl will take what I've been writing about tonight as advocating for a kind of politics of despair. 

of saying that since we are all sinners, what's the point of even trying? 

the point. for me.

is compassion. empathy. understanding. 

is really REALLY giving ppl the room to really and actually *be* human. 

it's moving beyond trite declarations and affirmations that 'we're all human'

im human. sorry for living.
