so i went and saw the star war

it wasn't as good as everyone's reactions led me to expect. but it wasn't awful either, so that's a win, imo.

i do think its interesting how the very few white fandom ppl i still follow have been reblogging lots of gifs and whatever of poe but not of John Boyega.

Finn is very handsome. significantly more so than poe. 

(also a little young for me so that's all i'm going to say about his looks)

the discrepancy is pretty interesting (and anti-Black and not really surprising)

if i only followed white fandom ppl, i'd have entered the theatre expecting that poe is main character, rather than a supporting one.

i would've been surprised to find out that Finn is actually one of the main characters.

(seems that way to me, bc its pretty clear they are setting him up to have a continued, big role in the rest of this trilogy)
