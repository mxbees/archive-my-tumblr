i might consider doing video reviews of books...

it'd be easier and i think ppl might be more amused bc i get a lot more animated when talking about this sort of thing.

hard part, of course, is captioning.

which i find very labour-intensive and draining.

(i basically got 'fired' from my captioning job bc i was too fucking slow. something about captioning tends to trigger my hypersomnia and i struggle to stay awake and aware enough to do the job which then takes a lot of time and wipes me out.)
