holy shit. i'm seeing an ad on tumblr for a local drugstore chain and makeup....

and. they do a face on this model.

and it looks fucking *awful*. all the shades are wrong. like. she's white white white.

and her skin, at the end, has a weird orange hue.

they also have a brand of makeup (nyx) in the ad that they don't actually sell.

(not that i've seen anyway. nyx in canada is usually stocked at rexall)
