i think one of the most interesting things, at the moment, to me

as a person deeply interested in intellectual history

is seeing.... my own (small) influence.

seeing how ideas are transmitted and circulated

but also not really being able to talk about it

bc ppl would likely get REALLY mad at you

for pointing out these patterns.
