i didn't watch the oscars. in part bc i don't own a tv. but also bc i don't care.

i'm preemptively exhausted by the asian anti-Blackness i've already seen.

also preemptively exhausted discussing Chris Rock's comments. 

i honestly have more important things to think about than one Black man's shitty joke.
