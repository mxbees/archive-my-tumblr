hours later i'm still annoyed at that ask. 

do ppl really not get the reality of being online?

and talking about the sorts of things i (and my friends) talk about?

about being the kinds of people we all are?

when i say 'most ppl i know have been targets of smear campaigns'

i'm not just talking about friends or ppl i like.

i could probably come up with a list of at least 10 ppl off the top of my head.

i literally read a story today about someone who was targeted bc their twitter handle 'sounding' like a neo-nazi thing.

despite having zero actual connection to anything neo-nazi/white supremacist. no 'receipts' were provided. no links to anything the person actually said or did. nothing. and months of harassment ensues.

this is why i wrote [9 strategies for navigating internet drama](http://syx.pw/1Wu3sOO) and why so many suggestions were 'be critical and use ur best judgement'. 


believe what u want to believe. u might choose wrong. but we all have to live with ourselves and the decisions we make.
