you know what I hate? 

when ppl share some story of oppression or discrimination and then someone responds with

'this is illegal. ppl aren't allowed to do this. there is such and such a law. blah fucking blah.'

srsly? what the fuck does it matter? like. u get that ppl do this shit all the time and fuck the law?
