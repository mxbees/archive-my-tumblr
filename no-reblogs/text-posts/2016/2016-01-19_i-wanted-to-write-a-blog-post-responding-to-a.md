i wanted to write a blog post responding to a common trop in fiction.

that hope is what you need to survive and to live.

that hope is what gets you through.

this is still too fucking high minded for me. 

all my dreams are dead. i have zero belief that my life will get better. or improve.

yet here i am. struggling to survive.

i survive bc i don't want to die.

(not yet or not enough)

there's no hidden virtue here. no big meaning. no grand purpose.

just this base, animal desire not to die.
