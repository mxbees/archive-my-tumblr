oh. hey. my gov't also classifies mental illness as a chronic disease.

this helps explain why i was able to get them to start paying my student loan.

my doctor only put 'autism, depression, and anxiety' for why i'm 'permanently disabled'

(although i'm going to start getting him to put sleep apnea too)
