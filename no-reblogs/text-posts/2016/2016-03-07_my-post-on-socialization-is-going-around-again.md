my post on socialization is going around again.

and i feel like i ought to write an update since i wrote that like... two? three? years ago.

while i still hold the same perspective, i'd probably elaborate on my point in a slightly different way.

bc apparently some ppl have forgotten that social dysphoria is a thing

and that (some) trans ppl will experience it as a result of being treated like something they aren't (ie, social dysphoria as a consequence of the cognitive dissonance of ppl treating you like a boy when ur actually a girl).
