i take rice Very Seriously, as it is my staple food.

every time the doctor is like 'u need to reduce carbs bc ur liver is fat. like... no rice, bread, pasta, etc'

and i'm just like...

i'll never stop eating rice. not ever. i'd rather loose ten years off my life.

also. when i did allergy testing for food, i specifically told them not to test rice bc i don't want to know if i'm allergic.

given my apparent desire to Catch All The Allergies

its a real posibility. and one i refuse to even enter my life.
