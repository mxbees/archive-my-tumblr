things i'm happy i did today:

- write a bash wrapper for the pinboard api
- clean
- do a fresh manicure

i wanted to clean more than i ended up doing, but then there was barfing and so i didn't. 

(also just ate popcorn which usually isn't any issue for me... but now i feel like barfing some more. but i'm going to keep it on the inside, i think.)
