realizing a thing about what i'm seeing about ace discourse and the zombie sex thing

like beyond just continuing to add stigma to ~deviant~ sex

its also pretty much shitty directly on ppl who do get STIs. 

as if there wasn't already enough shame and stigma there.

as if Black trans women aren't in one of the highest risk groups...

like. how many times have i seen ppl say that framing being HIV- as 'clean' is disgusting. 

and yet....
