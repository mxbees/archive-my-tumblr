you want to talk about mitigating circumstances and contexts?

sure. lets do that.

expecting, for example, children to be able to do as much and be as accountable as adults

is fucked up and wrong.

which is why we typically don't do that.

same with people who are experiencing some other kind of oppression.

the more privilege you have, the greater your ethical obligation.

easy enough, no?
