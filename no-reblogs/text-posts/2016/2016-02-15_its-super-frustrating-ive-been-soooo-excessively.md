its super frustrating. i've been soooo excessively sleepy these past few days.

as soon as it is noon, i feel like i spend the rest of the day yawning and fighting off passing out.

i'm guessing this is probably why i haven't been able to write as much.

i'll start writing and then fall asleep in the middle of a post

get all confused and stuff it into my drafts.
