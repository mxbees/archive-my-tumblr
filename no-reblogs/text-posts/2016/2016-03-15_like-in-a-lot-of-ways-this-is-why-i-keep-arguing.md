like. in a lot of ways, this is why i keep arguing against all umbrella terms. 

not only are our experiences different depending on context, these attempts to create a 'good' umbrella just obscures the reality of **inter**-community hostility. 

moreover, if we, for example take that article by Maria Lugones seriously, we can't even create a coherent whole of 'trans'. even within the modern/colonial gender system, white people have different genders than other races. 


like. we can't even coherently posit the existence of a trans community as a singular whole. 

why do ppl think its possible across so many disparate (albeit overlapping) 'communities'????
