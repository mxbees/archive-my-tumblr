<p>One thing people might notice is that I'm loathe to say anything proscriptive about what ought to be done.</p>&#13;
<p>Because I really don't know. I can see problems with stuff. But few solutions.</p>&#13;
<p>But I'm also wary of solutions.</p>&#13;
<p>Because many of us have internalized stuff. Some of us have privileges. We are all, however, embedded in this context of a world designed to perpetuate oppression.</p>&#13;
<p>To a certain extent, we can get some clues about where to go from previous points in history. But this has limits, since what works in a pre-industrialized culture may not work now (even if we ignore the issues of exploitation and appropriation of Indigenous knowledge).</p>&#13;
<p>But. I think, for where we are, the problem is that we are, as the story by Zhuangzi says, frogs at the bottom the well. Our current perspective is too narrow to be able to know the potential awesome that could exist.</p>&#13;
<p>We have dreams of the north sea, but dreams aren't a map. </p>
