actually, on second thought, what i read was worse,

despite being written by Authentic Gay Men(tm).

what i read set me up with the expectation that i'd get out of school.

and fall into the welcoming arms of the Gay Community Inc. 

at least with these mm books there is about zero implication

that a gay community exists at all.

which is... strangely, closer to reality than the books i read.
