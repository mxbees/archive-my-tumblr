<p>It is important for me to always remember that there are no intrinsically moral IDs such that there is no way you can ID that necessarily means you aren't being oppressive. </p>&#13;
<p>Why?</p>&#13;
<p>Actions. Actions are what matter. (actions and their consequences)</p>&#13;
<p>You stay who you are, always.</p>&#13;
<p>What you do, however, is something you are always accountable for and nothing excuses being oppressive.</p>&#13;
<p>No one really cares how anyone else identifies (which may shock otherkin and vegans). </p>&#13;
<p>No one cares.</p>&#13;
<p>If you note, what people care about is what you do. All the criticism people who ID this way get is about the things they are doing to contribute to the oppression of others. </p>
