i just did a little bit of extra work on the (unpublished) biyuti publishing patreon page.

according to my calculations, it'd take about 2000 dollars to pay me minimum wage to work full time with it.

or the same amount of money to do a minimum wage job for two ppl at 20hrs/week.

basically, 50/month breaks down into 5 minimum wage hours/week.

honestly? it'd be really fucking awesome to get compensation for even part time work.

(note: minimum wage in my province is 11.25)
