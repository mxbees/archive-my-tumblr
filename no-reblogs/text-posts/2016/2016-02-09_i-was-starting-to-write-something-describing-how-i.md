i was starting to write something describing how i (used to) manage executive dysfunction.

at least while i was in school. i'm not managing quite as well now, since my school strategies aren't really effective in my current context

but... i went into a huge digression about how i needed to pick a vital, necessary part of my life to simply abandon so that i could stay in school.

except that so much of what i have to say is deeply embedded in a context where you have to learn how to manage executive dysfunction without even knowing that you have a problem with it. without even knowing that you have a problem/disability at all.

i was undiagnosed (even self dx) the entire time i was in school.

it never even ocurred to me that maybe the reason why everything was so hard all the time was bc i might be disabled.

i'd been raised (abused) with the idea that ignoring your body and mind and pushing yourself to work, despite how much it might be harmful for you is a virtue. 

i didn't know how to listen to my body or mind when it was telling me to stop. that i'd reached my limits. not until i literally went crazy for a day bc the stress of it all broke my mind.

only then did i understand that i couldn't do all the things i was told that i should be doing.

and yet... it still didn't occur to me that i might be disabled.

i just resigned myself to living a half life.
