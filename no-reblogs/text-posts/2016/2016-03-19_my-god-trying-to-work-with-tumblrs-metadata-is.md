my god. trying to work with tumblr's metadata is so fucking annoying.

as far as i can tell, there's no consistent way to distinguish between original posts and reblogs in the metadata.

(this is where all the testing is coming from. i finally managed to write a script for downloading all posts from a tumblr... but i'm trying to see if i can filter out reblogs. so far the answer is 'no'.)
