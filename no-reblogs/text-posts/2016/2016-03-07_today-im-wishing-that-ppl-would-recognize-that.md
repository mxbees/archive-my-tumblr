today i'm wishing that ppl would recognize that 'patriarchy' isn't a monolithic concept.

like. bell hooks is very right to be specific when she calls a certain brand of patriarchy:

'white supremacist capitalist partriarchy'

and maybe some of us need to ensure we're a little more exact when we talk about 'the patriarchy'
