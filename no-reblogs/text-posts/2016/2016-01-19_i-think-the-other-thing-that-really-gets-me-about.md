i think the other thing that really gets me about current aspects of online discourse and ideological purity

is that......

we'll see these feel good posts about resistance and survival and all that fucking shit

but very few ppl really want to talk about or acknowledge

the messy fucking reality of what surviving entails.

the compromises u need to make. the shit u need to swallow with a smile.

you reach a point where u realize that

purity = death

and while you'd make a beautiful martyr

despite everything

you still want to live.
