i do really call it begging for a reason.

bc i like to be honest with myself.

i've actually thought about begging in the streets....

the reason i don't? bc i currently have access to a type of begging that people on the streets don't have. and i don't want to take up space that they need.

begging has kept me alive over the past few years.

and i'm so grateful to all the strangers willing to give me money.

but i do beg.

i don't 'fundraise' or 'crowdfund'

i beg and i do try to figure out ways to be 'better' at it.

bc this is a matter of survival.

not really proud of this (i was raised to believe accepting handouts is shameful)

but i'm also not going to be shamed either.
