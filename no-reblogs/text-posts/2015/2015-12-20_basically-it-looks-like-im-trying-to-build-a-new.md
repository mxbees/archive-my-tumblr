basically, it looks like i'm trying to build a new aesthetic

off of cheaply available accessories bc i can't actually afford clothing.

so a  scarf? ok. i can do that.

esp. since i topped up my wardrobe recently with 9 fairly unattractive sleeveless tops.

all navy blue. each cost .

i wear the same pants and hoodie everyday. i literally look the same always.

so. accessories.
