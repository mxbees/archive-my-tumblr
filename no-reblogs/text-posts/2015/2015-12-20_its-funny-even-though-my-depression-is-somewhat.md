its funny. even though my depression is somewhat more manageable now (bc meds)

i still often just go end up laying in bed to listen to audiobooks.

like. i'm so foggy/sleepy right now that i can't really *do* anything.

my body is sore and tired.

and all i can think about is crawling back into bed.
