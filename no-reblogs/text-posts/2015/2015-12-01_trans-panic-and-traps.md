(tw: violence, transmisogyny, some graphic details of violence)

Today I found out that [the white marine who 'homocided' a trans pilipina, Jennfier Laude, in the PH][1] was convicted with homocide. This is a lesser charge than murder.

There are a lot of reasons why I've been... displeased with this entire affair. I mean. The fucking US military needs to get out of the PH. But also knowing that earlier, marine br0 was actually using the trans panic defense:

> The trial was closed to press, but Pemberton’s lawyers said he hired Laude for sex after the two met at a club on Oct. 11, 2014. Pemberton’s lawyers told local media that he admitted to choking her in a nearby hotel room after discovering she was transgender, but claimed she was alive, though unconscious, when he left her.

> “He said he felt that he was being raped — he was so repulsed and so disgusted because he did not give his consent to allow a man to do that to him,” one of his attorneys said in an August 2015 news broadcast, in a point that became a key part of his defense. Another of his lawyers added: “Pemberton acted only in defense of his life and honor.”

I'm glad, at the least, that the judge did not buy this defense, saying that his feeling threatened did not amount to a sufficient reason to kill Laude. However, the panic defense did have the benefit of reduce the conviction to homocide from murder:

> However, she said that “the mitigating circumstance of passion and obfuscation should count” in Pemberton’s favor.

So. To sum this up, his trans panic isn't a good enough reason to kill her but because he was trapped, it wasn't murder. Okay.

He outright admitted to killing her. But because he was trapped, its not that bad.

I feel like... there is something I could write here about SE Asian trans women and ladyboys about traps... bc frequently the (white) discourse about trans sex workers is all about how they absolutely are predators looking to trap these poor cis men into paying for sex. Or whatever the fuck. I see variations on this theme whenever I see white cis men talk about Thailand, the PH, Malaysia, etc. It plays a huge role in sex tourism...

But. Honestly? I want to write this, but I can't right now.
