Based on something I'm seeing on my tumblr dash, here's an observation:

Literally every time I've seen a (non-Black) Asian try to frame themselves as 'radical' or 'edgy' or whatever about dealing with racism against Asians, they are generally some of the worst anti-Black Asians around.

It's gotten to the point when if I see anyone with a username that involves some kind of slur used against Asians or some other some such word that references a concept about the experiences of Asians under white supremacy, I pretty much know that they'll be saying some blatant, obvious, and unapologetically anti-Black garbage.

And I haven't even mentioned how almost all of these ppl use AAVE as a way to sound 'tough'.
