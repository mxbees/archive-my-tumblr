anyway. i think i have a lot of traumatic experiences that i haven't processed

that i don't have the time or resources to really process or think about.

and i'm kind of lucky that i'm an emotionless robot and can put off dealing with this stuff

(even as it festers beneath the surface and finds a way out anyway)
