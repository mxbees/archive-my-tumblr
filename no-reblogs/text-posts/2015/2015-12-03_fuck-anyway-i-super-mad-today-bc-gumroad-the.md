fuck. anyway. I super mad today bc gumroad (the service I was using to sell my ebooks) has decided that I must give them really sensitive information in order to get paid. 

which means that I'm not ever going to get the $70 in sales that they were supposed to send. 

im going to refund everyone's money bc i don't want them to have the money. 

and now I have to find an alternative that I can afford.
