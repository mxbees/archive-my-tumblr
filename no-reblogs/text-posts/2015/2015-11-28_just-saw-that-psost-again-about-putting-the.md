- transmisogyny is fun for the whole family
title: ''
---
just saw that psost again about putting the straights, gays, and lesbians on separate islands.

and most of the responses are super amusing...

except the casual transmisogyny that no one apparently has a problem with.

why would lesbians need to travel to gay island for semen? 

like. at its most basic, the fact that trans ppl exist (and can reproduce btw) means that even if gay island and lesbian island never interact with any off their respective islands, they'd *still* be able to reproduce.

i just appreciate being able to read something fun like that and remember how much ppl care about trans women... wait...
