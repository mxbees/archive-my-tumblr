again seeing white ppl talk about class.

srsly. i hate white ppl who talk about class. all of you.

i think the thing that gets me the most is that every single one you

truly really earnestly

thinks ur saying something groundbreaking and original when you claim that 

'poor whites have it worse/get less attention/whatever' than poc or teh gays

but its literally the same tediously boring point repeated a million times.
