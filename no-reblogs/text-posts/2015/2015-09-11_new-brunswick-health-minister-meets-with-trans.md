title: New Brunswick health minister meets with Trans activists
---
> Members of the New Brunswick Transgender Health Network met with the provinceâ€™s health minister on the issue of covering the cost of gender reassignment surgery for the first time Thursday.

> New Brunswick is the only province in Canada that does not pay for gender reassignment surgery.

> Members of the New Brunswick Transgender Health Network say Health Minister Victor Boudreau did not guarantee that would change. Instead, they say they got a commitment that the issue is being taken seriously.
