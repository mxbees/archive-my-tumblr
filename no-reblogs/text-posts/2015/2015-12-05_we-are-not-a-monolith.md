title: we are not a monolith
---
I'm thinking about monoliths this morning and how, despite 'we are not a monolith' being an oft repeated phrase, it really seems like few people have truly integrated this into their worldview.

By this I mean how, after being called out for something or other, people will often turn to their friends to seek reassurance and comfort that they are, in fact, 'one of the good ones'. I know this happens bc I used to do it myself. 

Not only does this involve asking for emotional labour from your friends, labout that really isn't their burden to carry btw, but it fundamentally fails to understand that we are not monoliths. In other words, at its most basic level, this perspective involves wholly entrenching the class distinctions determined by oppression. It is about reducing people to their respective class and not truly seeing them as an individual human being.

If one Black person calls me out for being anti-Black (which has happened many times, btw), the fact that my Black friends don't perceive it the same way is largely irrelevant. Or the fact that my Black friends know me well enough (and like me enough) to give me the benefit of the doubt. Also irrelevant. 

In a lot of ways, whether or not I'm anti-Black isn't really determined by any given Black person's subjective opinion about it. I'm not Black. Thus, I am anti-Black. This is simply the way that institutional oppression works. Whether or not some Black people do not personally feel victimised by my anti-Blackness is, of course, up to them. But this personal opinion does not and cannot change our relative positions.

I think this is actually one of the most challenging aspects to understanding insitutional oppression. It is a hard truth to swallow that you, at this very moment, are actively participating in the oppression of friends, lovers, etc. These are people you *care* about and yet, here you are, oppressing them. Why don't we all just stop?

Its a strange thing to understand that 'systems' of oppression are really the aggregate creation of many individuals simply living their lives and (often) doing the best we can. What I'm describing above makes it sound like individual decisions and actions are meaningless, because of this system. Except, if we *are* the system, then our actions do actually matter. But why isn't not directly or overtly oppressing our friends enough? Wouldn't things substantively change if *everyone* stopped oppressing the people nearest to them?

Who knows? Maybe the answer to that question is 'yes'. I don't think it is. In part because, as a whole, we are a species that thrives on memory and culture and history. We codify our beliefs and feelings into the languages we use, the cultural institutions we create, into the history we record, and etc and so on. This is why, even after the spaniards and americans left, Tagalogs just shifted to fill the void, rather than an immediate undoing of hundreds of years of colonization. These systems were built with the intention to have greater endurance than any individual human. To be larger than us, so that even as the builders are long forgotten, we continue to live in their houses.

We are the system but the system is not us.

We are not a monolith.

Surprisingly, I've actually found greater peace in truly understanding this axiom of teh discourse. Understanding and accepting the implications. Prior to doing so, I was often paralyzed by guilt or felt the heavy burden of needing the 'please' everyone (ie, maintain a level of purity so that all Black ppl would think of my as friend or ally or whatever the fuck).

Understanding that this isn't possible has allowed me to properly contextualize my guilt and to move past it. It has released me from the constant worrying about whether or not I'm being oppressive or harmful (because I already know that the answer is 'yes, I am'). I no longer need my friends to reassure me or comfort me when I get called out for being oppressive. 

And it isn't just the old saying that 'you can't please everyone' but rather what I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't even *try*. That the attempt and idea that you can 'please' everyone in a large, heterogenous group of individuals necessarily means viewing them as a monolith.

Let the idea go. And move on to actually doing what you can.
