so. i have been listening to my doctor and practising good sleep hygiene.

the problem though? i keep fucking falling asleep at my desk.

it start with maybe 5 or 10 minutes.

but now i'm passing out for like, half an hour.

this is exactly why i was taking scheduled naps in the first place.

and the days where i don't pass out at my desk

i inevitable reach a point in the afternoon where i'm too

tired/fatigued

to think coherently.

in conclusion: sleep disorders are fun.
