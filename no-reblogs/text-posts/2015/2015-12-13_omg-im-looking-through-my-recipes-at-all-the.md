omg. i'm looking through my recipes at all the stuff

i haven't had the spoons to cook in forever

and the stuff i'd like to try but still don't have the spoons to try and learn a new recipe.

there are a bunch of Chinese dishes i'd love to learn

(primarily: disanxian. but the recipe seems... complicated).
