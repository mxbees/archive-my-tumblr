title: Information Literacy and Cognitive Loads
---
Remember how [I wrote about a month ago on information literacy and cognitive loads][info]? And got a bunch of random losers missing the point and making it all about one not so critical part of the post (ie, '[cognitive load][load]')? I want to actually dig into this a little bc, after all, I am an information professional and I figure people could use some additional info and context.

Information literacy is a pretty old concept in library and info science. [The old standards][lit] used to define info lit as "a set of abilities requiring individuals to 'recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information'". With the following skill set:

- understand how much info is needed
- access the needed info effectively
- critically evaluate information and its sources
- incorporate desired info into your general knowledge
- use info effectively for a desired goal
- understand economic, legal, and social issues around the use of info
- access and use info ethically and legally

Now, these standards are about to be replaced by [a new framework][frame] for use within higher ed libraries/institutions. By and large, the people who've been mainly concerned and occupied with increasing info lit are librarians (and related info professionals).

In any case, take a look at that list of skills. None of these are necessarily skills you can intuitively obtain with zero or little effort. Like other kinds of literacy they must be learned and practised. Indeed, these are some of the precise skills you need to learn in order to reduce (in the long run) your [cognitive load][load], as it relates to learning. As in, the better you are at info lit, the lower your cognitive load is when trying to deal with new/novel information. Here's what wikipedia says about it:

> Cognitive load theory was developed out of the study of problem solving by John Sweller in the late 1980s. Sweller argued that instructional design can be used to reduce cognitive load in learners. Cognitive load theory differentiates cognitive load into three types: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane. Intrinsic cognitive load is the effort associated with a specific topic. Extraneous cognitive load refers to the way information or tasks are presented to a learner. And germane cognitive load refers to the work put into creating a permanent store of knowledge, or a schema.

Note that extraneous and germane loads are directly related to information literacy skills. More importantly, this is:

> Heavy cognitive load can have negative effects on task completion, and it is important to note that the experience of cognitive load is not the same in everyone. The elderly, students, and children experience different, and more often higher, amounts of cognitive load.

According to the detractors of [my post][info], the post was super disempowering. I was going to link to examples but I deleted them all (as I do at the end of every month). In any ase, one of the more coherent and sensible arguments was that fact checking is an acceptable addition to our cognitive loads when sharing stuff online. 

Which... yes, to an extent, I agree. But saying that ppl ought to just give up on fact checking was actually not the point of my post. The point being: info lit is a complicated skill set that not everyone is equally capable in.[^1]

As a disabled person who has varying amounts of energy to deal with things, I can't actually fact check everything I want to share[^2]. Nor can most of the people I know, also disabled. While we aren't specifically mentioned by the above, you can pretty much see that cognitive loads are more of a burden for disabled people (the wiki article later points out that some think that being poor contributes to your cognitive load).

The issue of cognitive loads re: online shit isn't trivial. Its important. Its especially important given that we currently have a coercive emotional environment that often guilts and shames people for not sharing 'important' information. That 'viral info' is a real thing that has impacted how we share information isn't really up for debate. The issue of cognitive loads isn't trivial when we are talking about multiply marginalized people whose situation and context automatically means they are shouldering a heavier burden than the more privileged. 

As such, shaming and guilting people over their information illiteracy is an awful shitty thing to do. Especially when the substance of your post is 'y u no fact check' as if this is a simple or easy task. It isn't. Especially given how info professionals are [now framing info lit][frame]. 

As it happens the first frame is "Authority is Constructed and Contextual", which more or less describes what I do: that determining credibility and authoritativeness of information is a complex skill that must be worked on and developed. Just as you don't pop out of the womb knowing how to read, you don't pop out knowing how to navigate the multitude of information environments we encounter with an intuitive understanding of what the 'good' vs 'bad' information is.

But hey, trying to get people to not feel guilt and shame over not being as literate as I am in info is disempowering, amirite? 

[^1]: Also note how in my OP the actual solution is that ppl.... stop posting false information. I'm talking about the sources, not the people who take that and share it. Like the news agencies who shared pictures of Brown people after the paris attacks as being involved... only for at least two of them to absolutely have nothing to do with it (one was intentional and the other wasn't verified by the journalist who initially shared it). This is what I was talking about how people appeal to authority as a way to establish credibility. I mean, if a news agency is posting a picture of a muslim woman and saying she's a terrorist? Most people aren't inclined to think "hey, maybe this newspaper is fucking lying". 

[^2]: Please do note the context in which I'm saying this. Despite being disabled, I am probably above average when it comes to information literacy. Not in small part due to the fact that I am, after all, an information professional who has actually be trained in this. I also, beyond this being my field, have a great deal of research experience within academia. And I'm telling you: I do not have the spoons to 'fact check' everything (which is why I reblog so little these days but this is a choice I've made. A choice wherein I know it looks like I don't care about certain things because I don't talk about them bc I'm too ignorant and do not have the capacity to learn enough to form a worthwhile opinion.). Shockingly, people have limits.
