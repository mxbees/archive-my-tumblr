title: social engineering and online security
---
Not too long ago, I shared an essay about why and how online security/privacy is something privileged people can only really access (at least in the ways more internet security people will suggest). This post is actually about a different security threat and ways to mitigate them.

It turns out that [social engineering is, for most of us, a bigger security concern][1] than the technical aspects of online security. Social engineering is:

> Strictly, social engineering is a technique to get around security systems—or any type of system—not by breaking through it or exploiting vulnerabilities in the system itself, but to exploit vulnerabilities in the humans around the system. Instead of breaking in or cracking a password, you convince a tech support agent to reset the password and give it to you, for example, or you trick a system into thinking you're an authorized user through some logical means using information you have available.

Honestly? This is an easier way for someone to hack your accounts than any of the technical ones. Cracking passwords is doable but can be time consuming or labour intensive. Why bother when you can just google someone's name and, using information they've posted on social media, just hack their account this way?

[Here's one example about how easy it can be to hack into someone's iCloud account][2]. [A prominent example of how one person's entire online life was fucked up bc of social engineered hacks][3].

If you read through the stories, you'll note that one of the biggest security weaknesses are 'security questions'. You know which ones I mean, "where did your parents meet?" "what was your first pet's name?" etc. Honestly? This is all info that many of us voluntarily share via social media. Much of which is indexed by google and, thus, easily found.

Remember how every so often there'll be a post on tumblr going "ur porn name is the street you were born on, your blah blah blah" and it just so happens that many of these chain-letters involve disclosing info commonly used for identity verification.

One of the easiest ways to figure out what info you should share online is simply to think about the sorts of information you need to provide whenever you want to reset your password, call a bank, etc. Whatever that info is? Don't share it. I recommend going through your accounts and figuring out what info people currently need in order to 'verify' that they are you.

A recommendation I saw elsewhere is to use a password to answer the question, rather than the actual answer. Something worth considering (just make sure it isn't the same password as the account itself).

But this concern isn't only about what you share... but what you store online with various tech companies. If you read Matt Honen's story above, you'll note that they daisy chained themselves into all of his accounts. Meaning: they successfully hacked one and then were able to use info found there to hack his other accounts.

Other bits of info I never share bc of the security risk: I don't give any tech company (when registering) my actual birthday. The thing about birthdays is that I know for a fact that this is one of the things my banks ask for when I call to do something with my account. 

Essentially, I try not to save info (even behind a password) online in case someone *does* hack one of my accounts. At least they'll not be able to get into other accounts (and some are easier to get into than others). This is why I was so adamant about not giving my SIN to gumroad. Not even for five minutes to get my payment and then delete my account.

(Why not? Remember how when you delete your facebook account you can log into it later on and it'll reactivate? We actually have zero guarantees from any of these companies that when you delete your account, this means they actually and entirely delete your data, rather than just making it invisible to the average user.)

Because this is the other problem. Hackers aren't the only ones we have to worry about unscrupulously using our data to harm us. These tech companies are no more interested in our actual well-being than any given oil company. They are all part of the capitalist machinery designed for one reason only: exploitation and oppression.

Okay, this has a lot less practical advice than I was hoping. But honestly? It really depends on your situation. And the best way to be sure about not sharing security question info or storing sensitive data is to look over what your current accounts actually use. And to not actually trust these tech companies.

One caveat: If you do start giving false information to these companies when creating accounts (or changing the info on your current ones), you run the risk of being locked out of your own account. This has happened to me on a few different occassions, where between the time I opened the account and when I tried to access it again, I'd forgotten what info I gave them. Thus, was entirely unable to regain access. However, this is a tradeoff I'm personally willing to make. If I can't guess accurately at my own security questions? I doubt any random person will either. I'd rather loose access to an account than have it hacked.
