title: Adult trans woman can get surgery and is competent after all
---
> A Bucks County judge dismissed an emergency injunction Wednesday, allowing a 48-year-old transgender woman to move forward with plans to have gender-reassignment surgery. 

> In court, Judge Theodore Fritsch said there wasn't evidence to show that Kitzler was in any way not competent or unable to make the decision for herself. 

This is such a relief.
