In Oregon a bunch of medical professionals are getting the FIRST-EVER train on how to better assist trans victims of sexual assault.

Some person notes that 'the training is needed because transgender people are both at higher risk of sexual assault and less likely to report it because they have not had good experiences with the medical community in the past', the only response is... no shit.
