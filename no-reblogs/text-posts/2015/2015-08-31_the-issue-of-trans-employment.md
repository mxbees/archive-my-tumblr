title: the issue of trans employment

[this is an editorial/commentary on an article]

This is normally the kind of thing that I read and decide not to share because it doesn't contribute anything meaningful. By this point, many people will know that a lot of jurisdictions in the US don't protect trans employees from discrimination. Many others, you know trans people, will have intimate knowledge of just how fucking difficult it is to get and keep a job. And my intended audience, trans women of colour, will definitely understand how this reality is compounded and magnified by race.

What caught my eye was this comment by Vanessa Sheridan, author of _The Complete Guide to Transgender in the Workplace_:

>"Up until very recently the media always portrayed transgender people as prostitutes or punch lines," she added. "We're not freaks or anything other than good citizens who want to contribute to society."

In case anyone is wondering, this is exactly what trans\*nationalism looks like. This is clearly assimilationist and not at all concerned about addressing the realities of why so many twoc do sex work. Being an older (wealthy/successful) white woman, it's clear that she has no fucking clue.

In a world where [Monica Jones can be charged with 'manifestation of intent to prostitute' for the sheer gall of existing as a Black trans woman][1]. This happened a year ago. Now, she wasn't actually do sex work. But some do. Some twoc aren't 'good citizens who want to contribute to society' and yet... they/we still deserve dignity, respect, and to live.
