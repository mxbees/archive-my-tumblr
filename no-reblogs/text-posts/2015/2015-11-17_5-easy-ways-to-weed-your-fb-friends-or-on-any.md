1. Unequivocally state that hitting kids, regardless of context is abuse.
2. Unequivocally state that all police are evil and that prisons should be abolished *now*.
3. Unequivocally state that every settler country (Canada, US, Australia, etc) must immediately dismantle itself and return the land to their respective Indigenous peoples.
4. Unequivocally state that all descendants of enslaved Africans must immediately be paid reparations.
5. Unequivocally state that any colonizing nation must all pay reparations for any and all wealth extracted during their occupation.

I think these are good enough.
