i might actually just cut my hair today. i'm too fucking sleepy to do anything else.

i can't think.

and i'm feeling less like i need to put the breaks on everything


bc i'm actually doing something more planned/intentional than my original impulse.

and i should still look cute.

and my hair is clean and almost dry.

which means it is prepared for donation.
