i think one of the saddest things i can point out about my life atm

is that of all the ppl i care about

i think i have the most stable financial situation.

note: \*stable\* is the key word.

and this is literally just bc i have a decent paying part-time job.

a job with *just enough* flexibility that when i was at my most depressed...

literally no one noticed that i basically did all of zero work for six or more months.

and i'm still poor enought that i have to beg for money whenever i fill my prescriptions.

:D
