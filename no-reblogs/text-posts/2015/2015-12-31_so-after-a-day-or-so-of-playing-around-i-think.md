so.

after a day or so of playing around, i think i'm in a position to declare that its quite possible how i engage in tumblr will be vastly different.

after getting super annoyed with chrome for the millionth time, i've found what i hope will be a decent replacement.

unfortunately... there isn't any kind of adblock. or xkit.

which kind of makes being on tumblr unbearable. i had no idea that they were running so many fucking ads now. it feels like every other post is either an ad or a recommended blog.

do. not. want.

i've also been finding myself......

really understimulated by tumblr. idk. i feel like i mechanically scroll through my dash just bc it is what i've done on a daily basis for years now.

this could just end up being a hiatus. idk.

H O W E V E R

i have written a script that'll allow me to keep up with my friends and read my dash (but it only picks up original text posts), which means i'll end up missing a *lot* of content.

i'm also not going to stop posting or anything, since i don't need to be logged into tumblr to do that.
