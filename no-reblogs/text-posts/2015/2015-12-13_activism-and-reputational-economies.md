Not too long ago [a friend posted this question][tala]:

> When will ideological purity stop being a foundation of activism?

[I replied][reply] that I had some ideas about activism(tm) being [a reputational economy][repute] and what this means as far as community dynamics (and how this relates to ideological purity.

The long post [I linked to about the economics of status][repute] lays out some of the basic notions of what it means to treat status/reputation like a commodity[^1]. As this is late capitalism, it is unsurprising that something like a person's reputation is a monetizable thing. This isn't to say that reputation, status, and prestige were unimportant pre-capitalism, but rather about how -- especially in activism -- it has actually become one of the most valuable commodities.

The basic argument is this: status can function like a currency because it is a medium of exchange, it stores value, and is a unit of account. The fact that it isn't quantifiable in the same way as the dollar isn't relevant. What is important is that one can become 'wealthy' in terms of status. For that sake of the article he defines status as "the total amount of social influence a person has over the members of [their] community". 

There are three more related notions that are key to understanding how status functions in activist communities. One is that status is "defined with respect to a community". The next is that status is a zero-sum situation (ie, accumulating more status necessarily means a reduction in status for others). The last is his notion of 'currency blocs': "a community is a group of people who agree on how to measure status among their members".

Obviously, the first and third are closely related, but they have different implications. The first simply states that what counts as 'status' in a community is relative to that community (ie, a marxist isn't going to be impressed with your investment portfolio). I'll be discussing the third in a moment...

Now as the writer points out, whether or not status is a zero-sum good is open to debate. However, what I'm going to propose is that within a capitalist context it necessarily must be. Capitalism forces us into any number of artificially scarce situations. More important, it matters that a lot of people who trade in status act as if it is a zero-sum game. Such that they are participating in this economy with the intent that accumulating status means that someone else looses it. I don't know about you, but this certainly describes a lot of my experiences with activism.

The third point? Is where ideological purity comes into play. Different communities measure status differently, easy enough. Rich people measure status by financial wealth (actually not just rich ppl but whatever). Academia measures status by publications and tenure. Activism? Measures status by ideological purity.

Remember that status is being defined as influence over the other members in the community. In Activist(tm) circles what else but ideological purity allows you to gain influence over your colleagues?[^2] Because of the...general disavowel of captalist modes of labour, Activism(tm) requires that your status is tied to something other than financial wealth. One could also suggest that it is a willingness to engage in uncompensated labour that builds status. But... if this were the case, then Black women/femmes would have a great deal more status in whatever community they participate in.

No. What matters in Activist(tm) communities is the performance of ideological purity. About how righteous others perceive you (status is not something you can confer unto yourself). Status is how you start getting people to invite you to do paid gigs (because no one makes a unknown person the headliner of an event). Status is how you are able to gain enough social capital to convert this into actually making a living being an Activist(tm).

The fact that status (a coincidence I'm sure) is also tied to relative privileges and layers of oppression is just icing on the cake. I have some ideas for why this happens, but it is pretty easy to see why this makes a difference. This is discussed later in the post in the section about the macroeconomics of status (ie, the status between different groups of people rather than between individuals within a community). Privilege is tied to macro-status. Macro-status does give people varying levels of startup capital for use to build micro-status within a community.

Its non-accidental that, for example, many of the twoc I know with high status within the community (insofar as one can be identified) are lightskinned. We start out with more capital and can easily leverage this into status within the community. As such, it's also non-accidental that the more marginalizations you experience the worse off you are. Non-accidental that, unsurprisingly, Black women/femmes tend to stick at the bottom regardless of what they do.[^3]

Amusingly enough, the answer to Tala's question is that Activism(tm) today is iinextricably tied to the economics as status and, thus, ideological purity. You can see it in the general expectation that people should willingly sacrifice their time, energy, and labour with little or no compensation (of any kind, not just monetary). And its sort of a vicious cycle, since the unwillingness for many Activists(tm) to bend on the notion of purity (ie by, idk, actually paying people who labour for teh movement), means they have to keep relying on status in order to keep making a living.

[^1]: General trigger warning for cissexism and transmisogyny in the link. He cites some evo/cultural psych shit that is 'bleh'. 

[^2]: Note: I'm not saying anything about various methods to gaining status. Some ways of acheiving status are better than others (for example, some people gain status by being aggressive and asserting dominance over the group).

[^3]: Recall Andre 3000's body suit statement, "across cultures, darker people suff most. why?". Anti-Blackness being what it is ensures that Black people occupy the lowest status in whatever community they are in. Factor in gender... and viola. Within a capitalist economy of status, this is unsurprising given that Black people were once property themselves.
