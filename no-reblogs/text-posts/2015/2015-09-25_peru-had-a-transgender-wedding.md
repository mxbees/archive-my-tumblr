> A historic first occurred on the night of September 19, 2015 when Thais Izuisa Tuanama, a transgender woman, symbolically tied the knot with her heterosexual partner of three years, Raúl Tello Reategui. The ceremony, which was witnessed by over a hundred of the bride and groom’s family and friends, as well as a sizable contingency of local journalists and television stations, began at 10:45 p.m. and festivities continued into the morning hours of the next day.
