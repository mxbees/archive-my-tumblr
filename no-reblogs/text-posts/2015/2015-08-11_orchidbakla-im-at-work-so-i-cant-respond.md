@orchidbakla

i'm at work so i can't respond directly to your replies, re: my tweet about tagalog/filipinx indigeneity. 

yeah...

i've heard similar anti-Indigenous sentiments from my family. both about groups in the PH and ones in canada.

it is also interesting how, before the spanish were kicked out, 'filipinx' was really for spaniards/whites born in the PH...

and then we decided to call everyone ~filipinxs~

except, you know, the ppl who'd managed to avoid a lot of the violence of the spanish and keep their traditions.

and we consider being colonized part of why we are 'civilized' (thus superious to our Indigenous ppls).

like... i really don't know how to resolve the basic paradox here.

tagalogs aren't Indigenous bc we marginalize ethnic groups who have their traditions, bc we act like our colonizers

but we act like our colonizers bc we were the closest to spanish settlement (which predominantly happened on our lands) and a lot of our traditional culture has been destroyed bc of the direct violence of settlement and colonization.

so the 'colonial mentality' that ppl like to talk about re: filipinxs is really a symptom of intergenerational trauma and a profound loss of identity, self, and culture.

like... it seems like we did understand why spanish rule should be resisted, but we haven't reached the point where we are actively resisting their _cultural_ violence.

essentially, i'm pretty sure most of my family doesn't even think to mourn all the traditions that we've lost bc of the spanish. largely happy praying to a foreign god and trying to live by foreign values.

and part of this is bc we stopped seeing ourselves as 'native' a long time ago bc the spanish told us we weren't anymore bc we converted to catholicism and took on their cultural markers and abandoned our own.

and one of the even bigger problems is that we can't (nor should we try to) go back or even necessarily recover a lot of what we've lost. it's gone. and how some have been trying to appropriate the culture of our Indigenous ppls... isn't a real strategy and is harmful.

we have to move forward... and i think part of this process is finally coming to grips with the full extent of violence we experienced at the hands of the spanish and then the americans. to actually get to a place where we can coherently understand ourselves as 'natives' in the way that we disparage in other groups. 

(note: all of what i've written here is really tagalog specific. and represents a bunch of the feelings i've been having as i've been doing research into our colonial past -- and present. i really don't think that tagalogs have any cause to try and call ourselves a 'post colonial' ppl. not when we cherish the spanish legacy of violence in the ways that we do. i want us to _heal_. bc i think if we can, we'll get to a point where we no longer marginalize Indigenous ppls or other ethnicities.)
