ok. but. my brain *needs* to nitpick about hydra. lol.

hydra is not a database.

hydra is a front end framework (written in ruby) for the repository software known as 'fedora commons'

fedora commons is not a type of database (this is intentional, btw)

while there are some database technologies used for digital preservation

ppl often pick fedora when they want a more flexible way to store data

that said... i actually see more libraries and museums using hydra

archives are more likely to use something like archivematica

(it depends on the size of the archive and its institutional affiliation most archives are simply too small and poor to actually support using software like hydra -- which requires either a developer within the org or paying for services. it gets expensive.)
