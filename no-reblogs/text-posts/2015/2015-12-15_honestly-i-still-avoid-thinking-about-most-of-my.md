honestly? i still avoid thinking about most of my dating/sex experiences as a youth.

i got caught up with shit that i'm only recently beginning to understand was really really fucked up.

one of the things that saved me, though, was being autistic. lmao.

i was too socially awkward for this one rich older white man who was looking for a rentboy.

and i'm sooooo fucking happy that i did not get into a relationship with him

(and i would've, given the opportunity, and it've messed me up bc i'm so impressionable.)
