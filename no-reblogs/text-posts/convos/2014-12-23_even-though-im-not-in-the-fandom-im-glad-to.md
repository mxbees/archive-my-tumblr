<p>even though i&#8217;m not in the fandom&#8230;</p>

<p>i&#8217;m glad to have a few convos about korra</p>

<p>that aren&#8217;t about ships</p>

<p>like. yeah. i loved the ending. it was very satisfying to me.</p>

<p>but it in no way absolves bryke of all the crap they did the rest of the series</p>

<p>the show was fucking <em>terrible</em> and frustrating.</p>
