#Introduction

This paper has popped up in a few different places and its ideas are being used in some... fairly interesting ways (most notably in the gender nihilist claim that gender is a colonial, white supremacist thing so it must be abolished/dismantled/whatever). In the convos I'm seen people apparently use this article as evidence for why, pre-colonialism, gender didn't exist. And why, to achieve decolonization or post-colonialism, we must somehow move beyond it.

I remember when way, way, way back in the summer of 2011 I wrote my first blog post. It was about how the cis-trans dichotomy (re: binary) becomes incoherent when applied in a poc context. I think it was originally called '[yet another binary][yab]' or something like that. Thus began a long path of my rethinking (and reshaping) the discourse on gender and colonialism. Not too long after that, I started interrogating the way that white enbies has been conceptualizing the 'gender binary' -- the first post on this was aptly called '[binarism and colonialism][bac]'. The rest, as they say, is history.

Not too long after the 2012 post, someone recommended this Lugones article to me, in addition to a few others. I also decided to [share some of these resources][share]. Although one person who got my writing (and this bundle of resources) a lot of attention was [a post by medicine][medicine], which has about 14k notes at time of writing.

I was excited to read Lugones' paper back then bc what she said helped confirm, to me, that my understanding of the relationship between gender, the binary, and colonialism was spot on. It was a relief not to feel like I was crazily making connections that no one else saw -- and, yes, I did have some moments of doubt bc I got harassed by reddit and others for articulating my ideas about colonialism and the binary). 

But... how can Lugones' work be used to entail two very different conclusions? My conclusion was that white supremacy/colonialism imposed upon the world a very distinct gender system, in which the binary we know was a critical part. Others have concluded that gender itself is a colonial violence forced upon the world, citing this very paper.

This is my critical reading of it.

#What people assume is her thesis

I think the key quote happens early in the paper:

> Colonialism did not impose precolonial, European gender arrangements on the colonized. It imposed a new gender system that created very different arrangements for colonized males and females than for white bourgeois colonizers. Thus, it introduced many genders and gender itself as a colonial concept and mode of organization of relations of production, property relations, of cosmologies and ways of knowing. (Lugones 186)

I'm pretty sure that this sentence 'it introduced many genders and gender itself as a colonial concept' is basically where the notion that Gender is colonial violence and not inherent to the various indigenous peoples it was forced upon[^irony]. Also by 'indigenous peoples' I really mean all the people colonized by white supremacy.

Now... taken on its own, I can understand where this conclusion comes from. But within the totality of the paper, I don't think it holds much water. She later writes:

> Understanding these features of the organization of gender in the modern/colonial gender system -- the biological dimorphism, the patriarchal and heterosexual organizations of relations -- is crucial to an understanding of the differential gender arragements along 'racial' lines. (Lugones 190)

To me the fact that she so consistently (and most prominently in the title of this article) takes pains to specify which system of gender she is analyzing and critiqueing and it isn't Gender. The subject of her analysis is the _modern/colonial gender system_ with "the biological dimorphism, the patriarchal and heterosexual organizations of relations" as its defining characteristics.

As she also notes:

> Gender does not need to organize social arrangements, including social sexual arrangements. But gender arrangements need not be either heterosexual or patriarchal. They need not be, that is, as a matter of history. (Lugones 190)

That is to say, that it is a matter of history that there are systems of gender that do not organize social arrangements. Furthermore, gender arrangements/systems aren't inherently patriarchal and/or heterosexual.

**As a matter of history.**

#The actual point of her article

As far as I can tell, this sentence does a great job of summarizing her actual thesis within this article:

> But it should be clear by now that the colonial, modern, gender system cannot exist without the coloniality of power, since the classification of the population in terms of race is a necessary condition of its possibility. (Lugones 202)

She is attempting to articulate how gender/patriarchy/binarism cannot be coherently removed from the totality of colonialism and its power and violence.

The mention of race is important here because most accounts of colonialism use race as the central 'technology' created by european colonists used to divide and conquer the world. Lugones' in this paper makes a pretty compelling case that we cannot understand 'colonialism' without taking the white supremacist, heterosexual patriarchy into account. That race and gender are (and have been since the beginning) intimately connected and mutually supportive.

#conclusions

Some people may or may not think I've done an accurate or faithful reading. That's totally fine. There is a link above that'll get you the article for yourself and you can read it and decide for yourself.

I don't think that this article supports a position that Gender is a colonial tool and that it wouldn't otherwise exist. That Lugones' specifically mentions that alternative gender arrangements/systems existed in history makes that pretty clear, imo.

In general, this also ties into something I've wanted to write about (but haven't yet). Which is mainly that people need to be a lot clearer of what they mean by 'patriarchy'. The term has become so closely connected to the modern/colonial gender system that many people think that all patriarchal cultures were the same. It has become this ahistorical concept that some like to see anywhere and everywhere. Even where not appropriate. 

But that's a post for another day.

[^irony]: I'm going to unironically use the capitalization from now on to denote gender as a monolithic concepts.
