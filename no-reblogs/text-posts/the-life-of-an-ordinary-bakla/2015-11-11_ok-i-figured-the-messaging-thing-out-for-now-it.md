ok. i figured the messaging thing out. for now, it is turned on for anyone to contact me.

not sure how long i'll leave this on bc i can usually barely handle doing IM with friends. my processing speed is too slow for synchronous conversations.

i'd still prefer that if ppl have questions of certain kinds, that they leave an ask, so i can take my time to reply. 

in general... i mean. my ask box has always been open. and i guess not too many ppl drop in which is cool. i think if IMs are used with that same level of frequency, i'll probably laeve it on. 

just. um. don't expect me to suddenly become your best friend. or expect emotional labour.
