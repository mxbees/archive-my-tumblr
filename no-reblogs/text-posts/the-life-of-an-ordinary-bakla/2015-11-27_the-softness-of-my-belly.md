title: the softness of my belly
---
In the sort of wonderful world of cognitive dissonance, I'm in an interesting place with trying to overcome my internalized fatphobia.

On the one hand, I still feel... not so great about my current weight. I'm getting better about it, but it is still something that doesn't entirely make me happy. This, of course, isn't helped by the fact that I am actually dealing with some weight related (or just general health related) medical problems. Or rather, even if not necessarily tied to my weight it is tied to my diet and overall has been stressing my disordered eating. Not fun.

On the other hand, now that my belly fat has lost its 'hardness' or whatever, I actually enjoy the tactile feeling of softness. I find myself periodically just squishing it and enjoying the roundness.

But then I'll catch a reflection of myself and see how my belly is also portruding and stretching the fabric of my shirt. Or I'll try on something that fit me a year ago that doesn't fit anymore... and feel kind of like shit.

It's a slow going process. Especially trying to balance out my need to be on a 'diet' but not, you know, put myself into eating disorder territory.

One thing that likely helps a lot is that I don't actually look at myself in the mirror all that often. And that I don't have a visual memory/representation of myself in my head. A lot of the times, its relatively easy to just not think about how my body looks. I'm hoping that this and the fact that I like the way my belly feels now will get me to where I need to be.
