in case ppl are wondering...

here are the areas in which i feel confident that i tend to know more than the average person:

- logic
- warring states philosophy
- information science
- digital preservation

while i do try not to be elitist about these sorts of things, most of these i won't 'debate' (insofar as i'm willing to debate anything these days, which isn't a lot at all)

i'll clarify. answer questions. listen to some perspectives. maybe even write some 101 stuff.

but debating with ppl who clearly have zero interest in entering a good faith discussion?

nope.
