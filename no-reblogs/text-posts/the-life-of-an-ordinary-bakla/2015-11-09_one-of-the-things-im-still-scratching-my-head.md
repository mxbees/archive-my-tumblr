one of the things i'm still scratching my head over is the fact that none of this is new... and yet. 

i've also not been shy about my critiques in the past. 

where were the callouts then?

its funny. i don't think ppl realize just how much i've self-censored what i write on here just to avoid this very problem.

bc i already know that there is no possible chance for discussion. no point in engaging. i'm not about to change my mind and i don't actually care about changing anyone else's mind.

hopefully we'll soon go back to ignoring each other.

i do think i'll just be blocking anons from now on. this is tedious and no one appears to have anything new to say to me.
