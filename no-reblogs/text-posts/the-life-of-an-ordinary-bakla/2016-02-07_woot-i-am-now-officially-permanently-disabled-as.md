woot! i am now officially Permanently Disabled as far as my student loans are concerned. :D

(this means that the government has started to pay off my loan. if i'm poor for the next ten years, the entire thing will be gone. likelihood i'll be poor for the next ten years? 95%)

the autism assessment was totally worth it, even if this is the only thing that comes of it. i think a month or so, the amount of money that has been knocked off my loan will be more than what i paid for the assessment.

also... i saw what my loan payments *would* be if i weren't poor.... 

my monthly payments are something like $500.

which, yes, is absolutely not something i'd be able to afford.
