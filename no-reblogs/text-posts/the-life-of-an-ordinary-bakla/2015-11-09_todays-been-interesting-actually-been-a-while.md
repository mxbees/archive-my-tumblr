today's been interesting. actually been a while since my big mouth landed me into trouble. the fallout of dissenting is pretty much why i never wanted to bother with the topic at all.

i'm happiest when we are all prentending like the other doesn't exist.

i got to see another example of the advanced derail i call the 'callout derail'. 

'gk isn't anti-Black, you're homophobic!'

de. rail.

beyond the reality of what my sexuality actually is, this is irrelevant. one does not cancel out the other, even when both are true.
