yes... i'm still thinking about sustainability and biyuti publishing.

i'm mainly processing in public, so ppl don't need to necessarily feel like i'm seeking advice or solutions (although i've been listening and responding to most).

if i want to start either contracting out more work *or* having employees, i'd probably need to actually make it a Real Business(tm). probably a non-profit bc, after labour/overhead, i'd want to put everything else into publishing and whatever.

if i have employees and/or contract workers, i wouldn't be able to make myself pay them less than my local minimum wage, which is $11.25 CAD (but for americans, i'd pay the equivalent in USD and so forth for people working with other currencies).

one of the areas i need the most help with, editing, is also one of the more labour-intensive/time consuming ones.

brain is now on a different track.

i might be able to save time/money if i switch how i do the website (ie, rather than self-hosting, actually host with the company that maintains the plugin i use for wordpress -- pressbooks). i think they charge like $100 for producing a print ready pdf. and they have a bunch of different book themes. this alone would cut out a lot of labour and expenditures, i think. might actually work better with a patreon set up too....
