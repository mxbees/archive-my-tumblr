<p>i actually kind of miss blogging on a regular basis.</p>

<p>life has me so buzy. busy enough that what time i have for writing, i try to spend it on my books.</p>

<p>except that i remember that i started biyuti publishinig bc i wanted to try and make money off of my already existing posts by compiling them into ebooks.</p>

<p>but now i&#8217;m just not blogging and only working on my books.</p>

<p>which kind of suck bc i actually want my target audience to read my stuff for free.</p>

<p>(also still struck by the notion that some ppl still don&#8217;t know who i am re; my previous &#8216;brand&#8217; name. like. i&#8217;m glad i did what i did. and i had my reasons for it. but i also still feel like i&#8217;m trying to rebuild my audience)</p>

<p>i still like having a distinct blogging space outside of tumblr, but i&#8217;m now considering migrating my blog content back into tumblr. in part bc this is the space where ppl really look for me first. and i could put some of my older posts back into rotation&#8230;. which would be really strange.</p>
