title: tips for engaging me
---
Not sure if ppl would be surprised or not, but I don't actually get all that many messages. Or ppl pinging me on chat. It does happen, though. Over the past few days (maybe a week?) a few different people have contacted me via tumblr's IM and... I haven't replied. I'm sorry for that.

In general, I'm not the biggest fan of synchronous communication. I process information too slowly and I like having the time to think about something before answering. All of my friends know that I don't like IM and tend not to use it.

I do read the messages, though. So I'm not ignoring you.

Lately, besides friend (who are always welcome to contact me, btw), I've noticed that most of the IMs come in one of two forms:

1. Someone is thanking me for something I wrote. 
2. Someone is asking me a question about something I wrote.

In both cases, I'd generally prefer if people just sent this type of communication as an [asks][ask]. I do get that sometimes ppl want to have a private conversation, which asks don't really lend themselves too. But... if I don't know you, it isn't likely that I'm going to engage in an IM discussion with you. I barely do this with my friends and... well, I'm def. not going to do it with ppl I don't know.

I'm not saying anyone has to stop, mostly pointing out that you are more likely to get a response if you send an ask instead of an IM. This holds true for questions that might be interesting to the 'general public'. I [mean questions like this one][q]. Given that, at the end of the day, questions like that are requests for intellectual labour, I'd prefer it if my labour is able to be shared with more than one person. Especially if it is of general interest. 

Regarding requests for intellectual labour... Since I am trying to make money at doing philosophy, I do sort of consider my patrons as people who support my ability to do it. This has meant, for the past few months, that I'm willing to answer questions with more time and care than I might've in the past.

So long as [the questions are like this one][q], you're unlikely to get a snarky response. Also. I have anon on so you can also ask that way so that I can share the answer without anyone knowing who asked.

Anyway, I just want to let everyone know. Ask a good faith question and I'll give a good faith answer.
