title: something that worries me
---
I was thinking earlier (in the shower, no less) about how one of the things I frequently worry about is.... whether or not I'm come off as my own brand of puritan. Or santimonious or some such similar notion.

Like, I know that I cannot control what people think about me (and that some are likely to think the above of me regardless of what I do short of just never saying anything at all). This really isn't about that...

I more talking about my writing style and how I engage people and their ideas.

One of the things I learned early on as a budding academic/philosopher was that in the white academic tradition, 'good' writing is assertive (this is significantly different than, say, Japanese academic writing which tends towards passive voice and 'suggesting' conclusions, rather than asserting them).

Example:

I was taught that 'Plato is a jerk who wrote Socrates fanfic' was more effective/better than 'It could be concluded that Plato is a jerk who wrote Socrates fanfic'. 

In other words, it is a style of writing that says that stating your conclusions as if they were actual facts is the thing to do. I'm sure people can see how this influences my writing today. It is still my manner of writing to state whatever conclusions I have as if there were Certified True Facts(tm).

Not to say that I don't believe what I say or have conviction, but my belief that I'm speaking the truth doesn't imply that I think I'm Right and everyone else is Wrong. Like, my commitment to pluralism kind of precludes that kind of fundamentalism (unless, perhaps, paradoxically about pluralism... but now I'm just getting meta, lol).

You only need to look at my writing from when I started blogging four (maybe almost five?) years ago. And what I write now. I do, indeed, change my mind. My thoughts and how I understand things evolves over time, as I assimilate new information and reach new depths of understanding. Or I just find out that I was plain wrong about something. Perhaps one of the clearest examples is in the intro do _decolonizing trans/gender 101_ when I discuss the rise and fail of 'trans feminine' in my vocabulary. 

When I look back at my Womanist-Musings post, for example, they can make me *cringe*. Fuck, this is even true of _decolonizing trans/gender 101_. Parts of it make me shudder in embarassment (which is why I'm working on a 2nd edition). And yet, in both cases (and in all my writing), my habit of asserting the truth of whatever I was discussing at the time remains. 

Part of understanding why I can have conviction *and* change my mind, is recalling that I'm a logician (at least by training). As far as my epistemological commitments go, I pretty much only think that math and physics produce Certified True Facts(tm). And yet, knowing what I know about the history of mathematics, even these are open to revision since we do not know everything there is to know about these subjects[^euclid].

On the other hand, however, I do think things like... the fact that my ancestors speak to me is just as true as any given mathematical one. This is something I'm going to write about elsewhere, the function of paradoxes in my philosophy. Likewise, for someone who believes in a monotheistic god, I think *that* is as true as my belief in my ancestors speaking to me. Except that, yup, this is contradictory. Both cannot (at least according to most logics) be true at the same time.

One thing that probably doesn't help re: being seen as a 'know it all' is that I rarely engage opposing ideas in real time. Not anymore at least. I've mentioned before that I process information very slowly. Which means that when someone challenges me on a point (that'll I'll eventually end up siding with them on), it can take me *months* or longer to really assimilate this into my thinking. Again, the 'trans feminine' thing is a good example. I think it was months between a friend challenging me on it and my eventual aggreement with her.

Anyway, I'm going to stop writing here bc I can't really remember why I wanted to write all of this in the first place....

[^euclid]: I think my favourite example is in the verification of non-Euclidean geometries. Geometry, up to that point, was considered one of the most stable and fundamental aspects of math. Everyone really thought that what Euclid wrote was the Complete Truth. Except... the rise of quantum physics and the math needed to work within eventually made it such that Riemmanian geometry was shown to be True (at the same time/event that Einstein's theory of relativity was proved correct). The point for me being: one of the most wonderful things about the universe we exist in is that what we understand and know can change in an instant. All of it.
