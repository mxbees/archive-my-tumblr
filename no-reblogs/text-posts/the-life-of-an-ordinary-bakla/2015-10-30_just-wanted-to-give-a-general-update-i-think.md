just wanted to give a general update. i \*think\* i'm going to go forward with making my longer essays into zines. i'm getting a proof made atm so i can see about printing and stuff.

which also led me down a rabbit hole of wanting to make the really cute 8 page, folded from a single sheet mini-zines too. and... i will do this! i'm going to be collecting a bunch of my tweets and putting them into mini-zines for everyone... :D

useful bc i've deleted most/all of my tweets from teh internets. and. my god. i finally managed to get all the text from like a year of tweeting and it was about 17,000 tweets with 250,000 words. WHAT.

but. yeah. i'm super excited and this is what i've been hyperfocusing on for a few days. trying to get myself set up and ready to do this. :D
