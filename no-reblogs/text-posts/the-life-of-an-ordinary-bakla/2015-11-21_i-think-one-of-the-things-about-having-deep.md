i think one of the things about having deep knowledge about certain areas is how often, when i share what i know, ppl literally think i'm making stuff up. or am completely ignorant and this is just my 'opinion'.

like. when i talk about logic**s**? rather than logic? or when i critique certain popular misconceptions about logic and white d00br0s on reddit dismiss me bc 'i'm a philosophy major'? (this actually happened btw).

the thing is, is that when you get really deep into a specific area. once you go beyond beyond the basics, there is so little certainty.

why? bc its literally the edge of what we know and we are fucking fumbling around in the dark trying to learn and understand more.

and so, often, ppl think i'm showing a deep misunderstanding about certain things. but i'm actually pulling from years of experience and time spent learning.

i also try not to open my mouth until i'm fairly certain what i'm about to say is true as far as i'm concerned.

i've no doubt that a bunch of ppl think i'm arrogant. esp. since i appear to listen so infrequently to opposing arguments/points.

i process information extremely slowly. it can take me years to form a solid opinion about a topic that i feel confident in asserting. i read opposing viewpoints *all the time*. i just don't see the point in discussing it.

i mean. my blog archives go back four years. it is pretty easy to see how i've changed my mind about things. how other ppl have impacted and transformed my worldview.

but it takes time. and effort. and i give myself the time and space i need to process what i read and learn. i work on my own schedule.
