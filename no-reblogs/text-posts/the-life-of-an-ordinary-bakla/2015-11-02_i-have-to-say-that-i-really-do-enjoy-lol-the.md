i have to say that i really do enjoy (lol) the glorious contradictions that my brain produces.

like.

even though i'm medicated and my anxiety is pretty manageable... i find that i *still* can't really handle the tension and conflict in my audiobooks. the more invested in the story, the harder it is.

like, i think i've had this one book on pause for like... months. bc i like the characters and something bad always seems around the corner.

one of the things i do to try and deal with this is read reviews and get spoilers (if i know what will happen, then the tension is tolerable). 

except that *sometimes* (re: often) reading the spoilers also demotivates me to finish the book. and so we have my current situation where i'm literally in the middle of like forty different books.

thanks, brain. thanks.
