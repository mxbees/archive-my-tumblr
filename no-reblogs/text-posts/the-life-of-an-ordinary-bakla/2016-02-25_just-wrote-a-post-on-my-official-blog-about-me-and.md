just wrote a post on my Official blog about me and disability. i totally derailed myself. lol. what i actually wanted to talk about is trying to overcome internalized ableism and to stop gaslighting myself wrt chronic illness.

its weird. idk why it has been so hard for me to wrap my head around this. i know that part of it is my bad habit of comparing myself to people who are 'more' disabled (and. ofc. by 'more' disabled i really mean less functional). 

like... compared to some ppl i know, i'm pratically living a champagne and cavier lifestyle.

one reason for this, i think, is that i don't see many posts on chronic illness that discuss being 'mildly' or 'moderately' chronically ill. it makes me forget that there is a variety of ways to be chronically ill.

(note: i'm *not* saying that ppl who're 'severly' chronically ill are taking up too much space. or that they shouldn't be talking loudly and frequently about it. they should. this post is me really just wanting to orient myself within this and maybe help someone else out who might be similar to me.)

<!-- more -->

inasmuch as i'm not a fan at all about creating... levels of illness, it would also be ridiculous for me to not recognize that there are some pretty clear differences. someone with chronic pain at a 6+ level isn't having the same experience as someone who averages a 2. 

even if we are talking pain management. literally no one (including me) would think i need narcotics to manage my pain. it really isn't that bad. and this means my experience of it isn't at all comparable to someone who *does* need it and all the shit that comes along with it.

but someone else existing at an 8 doesn't somehow make my 2 less painful. the baseline for judging ur chronic condition shouldn't be the worst possible scenario but... the people who don't have to deal with it. and this is something i need to remember. 

i'm using chronic pain as an example bc i have ibs. its something i don't see often in online discussions as a chronic disease. but it is. its also basically untreatable. but that's not the point. the point is that one of the defining symptoms of ibs is... abdominal pain. p a i n. which makes it a source of chronic pain. 

my bro also has ibs. and, overall, i'd say his is worse than mine. and since this isn't actually a zero sum gain, when we are both having flareups, his greater pain doesn't lessen mine. at all. not even a little. he feels his pain. and i feel mine. and both of us feel more than someone who doesn't have ibs or any other condition.
