i'm writing this out mainly as a way to synthesize new info about my diet and eating.

thing i learned from @lunamerbruja's visit: consuming the recommended (or close to) amount of dietary fibre means constant constipation.

its super frustrating bc everything tells u that fibre will help constipation and its  hard to find out what to do if fibre is a contributing factor. or even hard to find out whether or not fibre *can* contribute to constipation.

i tried adding in some more insoluble fibre (a lot of what i was eating was soluble). it didn't help.

but when Luna was here, my diet was really different from what it had been for a few months. no oatmeal. no beans. not really a high fibre diet at all. and pooping was both easier and more regular.

conclusion: i can't have too much fibre in my diet.

not sure if its bc it interacts strangely with my IBS. or just a quirk of my digestive system. but... there is less pain and discomfort when i don't have as much fibre.

this somewhat poses a problem bc i was eating lots of oatmeal and beans bc they're cheap, filling, and not high in fat (or processed sugar). bc i have a fatty liver, i'm supposed to reduce consumption of carbs/sugar/fat. which isn't really... easy when ur poor bc shit like pasta, rice, etc is cheap and easy to make. so... idk.

one good thing i did discover is that, at the end of it all, i don't actually think i have a dairy protein intolerance. i've been eating a fair bit of cheese since i cut out beans/oatmeal. no problems.

my breakthrough moment was after eating pizza and my gut protesting quite vehemently that it Hated Me. difference between how i'd been eating cheese vs eating pizza? the bread. specifically the yeast. i have no problems with pasta and other forms of wheat, so gluten or other wheat related stuff isn't a problem.

this was confirmed by my experience on wed. i'd cut out eating anything with yeast for a few weeks and my tummy was doing okay. and then i ate some naan. it was delicious. but my tummy let me know that It Would Destroy Me and Everything That I Love. so that's that.

bc yeast is something that's just a normal part of ur gut flora, i think the problem is that i get periodic overgrowth/flareups. for a while, eating pizza wasn't a problem. eating bread wasn't a problem but then... i made homemade pizza twice in a week and apparently that was Too Much.

not sure how long it takes for me to recover from a flareup but... we'll see?

more supporting evidence: just as the above occurs, i get another fungal rash on my foot. when i first saw the doctor about this, i thought it was exzema. which he thought was strange bc feet don't normally get that. but he prescribed one of those hormone ointments. and it would work for a few days. i'd stop using it. and the rash would immediately come back.

i finally managed to get rid of the rash by switching to an anti-fungal cream from the store. and, it turns out, that getting candidas/yeast rashes on ur feet (or underarms) is totally a thing. so...

in conclusion:

things i need to watch out for in my diet: yeast and fibre. i can't have too much (perhaps any at all).

which. ofc. makes me *super happy* since it isn't like i don't already have a giant shitload of dietary restrictions. :D :D :D
