so. i had my consultation to get tits today. 

i took an ativan bc i was getting super anxious and didn't feel like having to deal.

everyone at the clinic was super respectful, so i definitely feel like i picked the right surgeon.

(some of his language was.... out of date but not entirely. it was a weird mixture of 'ftm' and 'cis' and i was like... ok. but ur trying and u haven't called me a man and that's good enough for me)

i tried on some different sizes. not going super big. he predicts that we the size we settled on, i might be at a large B or small C. which is about right for what i wanted.

still.... really ambivalent about the whole thing. 

i just. none of it feels real i guess.
