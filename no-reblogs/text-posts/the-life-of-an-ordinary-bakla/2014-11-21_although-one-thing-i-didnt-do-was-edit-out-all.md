<p>although. one thing i didn&#8217;t do was edit out all of my &#8216;pauses&#8217;</p>

<p>what i mean by this, is that i didn&#8217;t edit my audio post</p>

<p>so that i sounded neurotypical. bc. well. i&#8217;m not.</p>

<p>the pauses i take aren&#8217;t necessarily me thinking&#8230;</p>

<p>i just sometimes stop in the middle of a thought/sentence</p>

<p>and it can take me a few seconds to resume</p>
