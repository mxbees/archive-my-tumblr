<p>i don&#8217;t care how many different kinds of ppl</p>

<p>tell me that i should hate and loathe my body</p>

<p>it isn&#8217;t going to happen</p>

<p>i like my voice</p>

<p>i&#8217;m pretty okay with my body hair</p>

<p>i like my genitals just fine</p>

<p>this body is mine</p>

<p>this body is me</p>

<p>i am this body</p>

<p>and while i have trouble with the whole</p>

<p>~love ur body~</p>

<p>thing</p>

<p>this doesn&#8217;t mean i hate it.</p>

<p>or that i want to be shamed for having it</p>
