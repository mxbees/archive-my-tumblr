I feel somewhat conflicted about the whole -phobia is ableism thing

like I get the argument 

im just "meh" about it. 

for a while I replaced phobia with hate. and it works. 

but just meh. 

what annoys me more is the general white disability approach of telling me what I can and.cant say. 

I remember that white person who tried to call me out over it and I was like... fuck u. I have a debilitating phobia so go away.
