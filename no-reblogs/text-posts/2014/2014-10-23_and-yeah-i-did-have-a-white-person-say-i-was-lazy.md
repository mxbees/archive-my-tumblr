title: And, yeah, I did have a white person say I was 'lazy' in my rejection of white
  rationality and logic.

<p>Lazy.</p>&#13;
<p>I suppose that means that Chan and Zen Buddhists are lazy, since there is a tradition of anti-rationality in their philosophy.</p>&#13;
<p>But tell me this:</p>&#13;
<p>Why should I value rationality?</p>&#13;
<p>No. Really. Why?</p>&#13;
<p>I do value truth. And facts. But neither of these things have to do with rationality or logic.</p>&#13;
<p>In my hierarchy of values rationality scores really low. I prefer love, loyalty, truth, sincerity, kindness, compassion, and I'm sure I could think of a lot more things I care much, much more about than I care about being perceived to be rational by white people (especially when, being a femme PoC, I'm incapable of ever meeting this standard).</p>&#13;
<p>But, hey, I'm lazy.</p>&#13;
<p>Lazy because I care more about people than I care about logical arguments. Because I'm on tumblr to make friends and not get into endless arguments with white people to prove I'm human.</p>&#13;
<p>So. Damn. Lazy. </p>
