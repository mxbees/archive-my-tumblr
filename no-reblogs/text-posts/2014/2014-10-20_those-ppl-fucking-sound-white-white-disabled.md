<p>those ppl fucking sound white. white disabled activists love to pull this</p>

<p>'omg. this set of traits is part of a disability, thus saying they can be abusive is ableism'</p>

<p>gtfo</p>

<p>i hate u all</p>

<p>there are so many different ways to be abusive. indeed&#8230;</p>

<p>while we can note that there are common/similar patterns of behaviour</p>

<p>it is also the case that it is as individual as the abuser and the victim</p>

<p>the problem with this line of thinking is acting as if there is some</p>

<p>objective, observable quality to abuse</p>

<p>IT DOESN&#8217;T WORK LIKE THIS</p>

<p>if the victim/survivor names their abuser and says &#8216;</p>

<p>this and this behaviour was abusive&#8217;</p>

<p>even if this is part of some diagnostic criteria for a mental illness or disability</p>

<p>IT REMAINS ABUSIVE</p>

<p>no one other than the victim/survivor has a right to decide if we were abused</p>

<p>fuck u</p>

<p>and ur support of abuse culture</p>
