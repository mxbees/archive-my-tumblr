title: Something that causes my heart to hurt

<p>That a definition of luck I just saw is avoiding becoming a victim of white eugenics (which is really a slow kind of genocide). </p>&#13;
<p>I often see sentiments like this, that avoiding x experience of oppression is lucky. </p>&#13;
<p>Every manner and way that we manage to resist oppression is awesome and should be celebrated...</p>&#13;
<p>But think about how awful this measurement of luck is. And other similar things. </p>&#13;
<p>While my family was poor growing up, we never went hungry. I feel lucky that I had enough to eat even though I didn't always have clothes that fit or were in good repair. I feel blessed about this. </p>&#13;
<p>But, fuck, not starving and/or not being a victim of eugenics is a pretty poor measure for luck. </p>&#13;
<p>This is the world we live in: </p>&#13;
<p>A place where I feel lucky that my poor immigrant one parent family had enough food. </p>&#13;
<p>Or someone mentioning they feel blessed to have medical insurance to access needed services. </p>&#13;
<p>Is it just me? Or should I stop thinking that this sort of shit should be the absolute minimum? </p>&#13;
<p>No families should starve. No one should fear eugenics. Everyone should have access to medical services. Etc. </p>&#13;
<p>I think of all the things that really make me feel defeated, it is when I feel blessed for shit that should just come out of the box for just being born. </p>
