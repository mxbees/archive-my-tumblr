<p>and i find it hard to want to get involved with what</p>

<p>appears to me to be just petty squabbles between my oppressors</p>

<p>like the ongoing transtrenders/truscum shit that i see</p>

<p>i don&#8217;t fucking care, ok?</p>

<p>erica has been pointing out for fucking <em>years</em> that</p>

<p>this is just transsexual seperatism repackaged</p>

<p>or Toni has likewise been great at giving historical perspective</p>

<p>to let us know that this conversation has been happening</p>

<p>over and over and over</p>

<p>again.</p>

<p>so often i see this stuff just bandied about between different white trans ppl</p>

<p>and i&#8217;m like&#8230;.</p>

<p>fuck you all</p>

<p>i hate <em>both</em> sides of this &#8216;fight&#8217; or whatever the fuck</p>

<p>a PLAGUE on BOTH your HOUSES</p>
