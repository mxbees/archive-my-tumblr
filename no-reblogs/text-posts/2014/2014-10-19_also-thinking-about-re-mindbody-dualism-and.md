<p>also thinking about re: mind/body dualism and healig and disability</p>

<p>like, that thing about how white doctors tried to go to Rwanda and &#8216;help&#8217; with the trauam</p>

<p>but couldn&#8217;t do a single fucking thing to help</p>

<p>bc all their solutions were too focused on the individual</p>

<p>white ideology functions off of reduction.</p>

<p>always reducing us to smaller and smaller parts</p>

<p>but never letting us be whole, complete human beings</p>
