<p>suddenly realizing why I it leaves such a nasty taste in my mouth when I read/hear about all these explorations about white masculinity and the crisis of 'men.'</p>&#13;
<p>because beyond the gross as fuck mra shit involved with it and all the zero sum shit it implies</p>&#13;
<p>it is always focused on *white* men</p>&#13;
<p>as if they didn't already have the most diverse representation in the media</p>&#13;
<p>as if they don't have a wide, wide ranges of self expression and modes of being available to them</p>&#13;
<p>as if they aren't the ones with institutional power to actually change whatever the fuck it is they are bitching about</p>&#13;
<p>because these narratives always frame them as 'victims' of forces larger than them... like capitalism, consumerism, etc, but this is all shit they are actually in charge of.Â </p>&#13;
<p>conclusions? fuck white men's fucking narcissism and acting as if all the people they are standing on should give a fuck about their problems</p>
