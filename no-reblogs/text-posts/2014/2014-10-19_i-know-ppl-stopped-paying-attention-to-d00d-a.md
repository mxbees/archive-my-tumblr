<p>i know ppl stopped paying attention to d00d a while back&#8230;</p>

<p>but that fucking bullshit about the point of &#8216;recovery&#8217; is health</p>

<p>and that tumblr promotes this culture of validation over recovery&#8230;
a</p>

<p>and it is like&#8230; are u fucking srs rn?</p>

<p>some chronic shit is chronic. that means there is no coherent path to &#8216;recovery&#8217; such that ur magical notion of &#8216;health&#8217; is achievable.</p>
