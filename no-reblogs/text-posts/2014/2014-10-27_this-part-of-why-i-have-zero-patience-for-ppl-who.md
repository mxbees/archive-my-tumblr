<p>this part of why i have zero patience for ppl who literally come</p>

<p>onto <em>every fucking donation post ever</em></p>

<p>to go &#8216;zomg, hdu ask ppl for money&#8217;</p>

<p>like. u don&#8217;t want to give anything? don&#8217;t</p>

<p>u don&#8217;t want to boost? don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>these ppl will literally pull anyting out of their asses to criticize u</p>

<p>there is no fucking dignity or glamour in being poor.</p>

<p>none.</p>

<p>this isn&#8217;t about fucking pride.</p>

<p>one of the key features to human survival is our ability and willingness to cooperate.</p>

<p>it is literally one of the most beautiful thing about us</p>

<p>'do it all on ur own!'</p>

<p>fuck off.</p>
