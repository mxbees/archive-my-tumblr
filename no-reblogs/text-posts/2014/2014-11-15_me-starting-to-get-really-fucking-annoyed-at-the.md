<p>me: starting to get really fucking annoyed at the puberty blocker post going around&#8230;</p>

<p>why?</p>

<p>well&#8230;.</p>

<p>the assumptions of the post</p>

<p>like. yes. obviously all trans ppl (young or old) should have easy and sufficient access to healthcare (trans related or not)</p>

<p>what irritates me is the subtle reification of the white, medical model of transness</p>

<p>that being trans necessarily is all about access to medical interventions</p>

<p>that <em>this</em> is what will make the key difference in the experience of trans kids</p>

<p>but nothing about how dismantling harmful structures of transmisogyny</p>

<p>would not only help trans kids</p>

<p>but trans adults</p>

<p>the trans experience is larger and more vast than what medical interventions we seek or do not seek</p>

<p>look. i have a trans niece and i definitely hope she is able to access puberty blockers if this is what she wants.</p>

<p>but i also want to let her know that her womanhood is not contingent or even related to the container that is her body</p>

<p>i also want to fight for a world where (racist) transmisogyny is dismantled so that however she ends up embodying her womanhood</p>

<p>she&#8217;ll be safe, secure, and supported</p>

<p>i want her to know that it isn&#8217;t white medical procedures that make her a girl/woman</p>

<p>i want her to know that our ppl have a history of #girlslikeus</p>

<p>that is also spiritual and cultural and social</p>

<p>and that she&#8217;ll be cherished and valued</p>

<p>just for existing</p>
