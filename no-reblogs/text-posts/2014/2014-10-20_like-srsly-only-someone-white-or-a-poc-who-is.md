<p>like, srsly. only someone white or a poc who is regularly coded as white</p>

<p>would think to themselves</p>

<p>'how dare u make assumptions about my race based on my white supremacist behaviour. i don't even know who my father was! and my grandpa said i might not be his grandoffspring'stop including this in your lists of abusive behaviours!11!!'</p>

<p>there isn&#8217;t some complicated rubric for knowing whether u aren&#8217;t white or not</p>

<p>while there are some genuine edge cases&#8230; these ppl usually know who they are too.</p>

<p>ur basically saying &#8216;no one ever told me i was anything other than white, so i might not be white!&#8217;</p>

<p>lol</p>
