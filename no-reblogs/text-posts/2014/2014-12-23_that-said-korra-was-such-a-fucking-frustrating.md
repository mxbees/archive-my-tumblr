<p>that said&#8230;</p>

<p>korra was such a fucking frustrating show</p>

<p>not necessarily bc it wasn&#8217;t as good as atla (it wasn&#8217;t)</p>

<p>but bc it had&#8230;</p>

<p>the potential to be SO MUCH better</p>

<p>i don&#8217;t like how the narrative treated korra (esp. in contrast with aang)</p>

<p>half the time i was watching i wanted to punch my monitor</p>

<p>overall, the writing was sloppy and unfocused.</p>
