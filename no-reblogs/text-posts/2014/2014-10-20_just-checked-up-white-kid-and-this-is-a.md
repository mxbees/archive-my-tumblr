<p>just checked, up, white kid.</p>

<p>and this is a classic example of bullshit white thinking</p>

<p>EITHER</p>

<p>a behaviour is abusive</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>a behaviour is a symptom of mental illness/disability</p>

<p>BUT NEVER BOTH</p>

<p>when reality is always more complex than this</p>

<p>whereas some behaviours are BOTH abusive AND symptoms of a mental illness</p>

<p>WORSE YET</p>

<p>sometimes a person with a mental disability</p>

<p>can have a behaviour that is BOTH abusive AND a symptom of their disability.</p>

<p>it isn&#8217;t the behaviour that is one or the other</p>

<p>it is the <em>person</em> that is abusive.</p>
