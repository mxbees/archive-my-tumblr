title: a short guide for successful e-begging
---
I've been wanting to write something on my observations about ebegging and what seems to work best (at least for me). I'll try to make this short...

1. Don't try to sell anything (I always get more money if I just beg).
2. Don't over explain (if ur begging on tumblr keep it around 250 words and have a key phrase that can be tweeted -- so less than 140 chars with the link included).
3. Give clear details about what you need and how much you need (see point 2).
4. Leave out any and all attempts at emotional manipulation (esp. the 'if everyone who follows me donates $1...'. This will never happen. Ever. Don't bother.)
5. Beg for small amounts more frequently (eg. 'I need a $100 to pay my phone bill' vs 'I need $1000 to pay rent').
6. Stop apologizing for begging. This will also help you cut down on the length of your begging posts.
7. You'll get most of your donations within the first day or so of begging. Plan accordingly.
8. Begging for specific reasons and amounts works much better than constantly begging (think about panhandlers... if you become too constant a presence, people will just start ignoring you).

**What follows in the 'readmore' is a discussion about ebegging and the ins and outs of it**

Um. All I can think of at the moment. One thing I do want to mention is that I believe in 'paying it forward' when it comes to begging. For example, if I need $100 but get $150, I'll usually donate all or most of the excess to other people (particularly those I know who have either greater need or less social capital than I do). This might seem counter-intuitive, since why not just save the money? You can, of course, if you want to. But this honestly makes me feel better about my own begging and helps deal with any guilt or shame I have associated with it. Plus, tbh? I actually just like helping people if I can.

Notice how I said nothing about follower counts? It really doesn't matter. For both tumblr and twitter, I have fewer than 1500 followers on each account. My entire time online, I think this is about the most followers I've ever had. Many of the people I know have signficantly. Some have far fewer. All of us are generally successful in raising necessary funds. Follower count is **irrelevant**.

What is somewhat more relevant is... social capital. Who you know (and who knows you) is way, way more important than numerical follower counts. Building (and maintaining) a certain level of social capital is actually much harder than obtaining large amounts of followers. And, tbh, there isn't any real formula to this beyond, from my observation, a willingness to engage in a lot of uncompensated labour. What I mean is via blogging, sharing drawings, doing emotional labour, something. Ultimately the 'compensation' for all this labour ends up being social capital. Begging online (esp. if you need large amounts of money) is a reputational economy.

Now... obviously, things being what they are, it is much easier for certain kinds of people to build social capital. Much like any other 'capital', the more privileged you are, the easier it is to accumulate capital. This is why bland white ppl who simply regurgitate what less privileged ppl say manage to accumulate large amounts of social capital.

There are ways to compensate, if you are oppressed on several levels. What appears to work best for me? Being vulnerable. I think this is one of the hardest aspects. A lot of ppl will only donate if they feel like they 'know' you. If you make yourself vulnerable enough for them to actually care about you as a person. Others might have other ideas for how to overcome the general malaise ppl have towards marginalized ppl, but... this is pretty much how I do it.

(Note: the above was not a conscious strategy, but a pattern I've observed over the years I've been begging online. I realize that writing it all out like this might make me seem like a calculating person and, well, its not this would be a false claim. The thing about poverty? It makes you desperate and often a little more morally flexible than you might otherwise be. 

However, I've always been vulnerable in how I blog. The difference now? Is I understand the role it has played in why I'm usually successful in raising the funds I need to keep surviving. Also? I could be wrong about this. I don't think I am.... but I could be. And being vulnerable isn't the only way to overcome the marginalization problem. I've observed people doing other things, but I'm just talking about what has worked for me.)
