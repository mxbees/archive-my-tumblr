title: meta intellectual dishonesty
---
i just realized that the one person's 'criticism' of me actually counts as met-intellectual dishonesty.

person replying to me: \*fallacious statement\*

me: that's a fallacy

person: oh. you don't have a rebuttal and you sound young.

me: ur intellectually dishonest

person posting in my tag after i blocked them: zomg! they blocked me bc they can't handle a 'friendly' debate. u can't just say 'that's a fallacy' and accuse ppl of being intellectually dishonest. u don't even know what words mean.

me: wow. now ur being intellectually dishonest about being intellectually dishonest. :)

i've written before how i'm kind of 'meh' about fallacy. however, if ppl do want to treat this like a fucking ~debate~ then, yeah, i'll point it out.

asking me to nonetheless engage and 'rebut' your fallacious argument is intellectual dishonesty.

why? bc you've already lost. ur inability to enter the ~debate~ in good faith has defeated you. then, piling on *other* fallacies isn't really going to make me think "hey, this person actually wants a discussion!'

to remind ppl, i don't owe anyone:

- my time
- my attention
- engagement
- discussion
- explanations
- or anything else
