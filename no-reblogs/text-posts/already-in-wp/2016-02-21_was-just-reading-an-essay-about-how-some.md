Was just reading an essay about how some writers/artists/etc promote their work on twitter....

And, of course, the worst method is simply spamming people with links.

What occurred to me, as I read through it, was that a lot of the behaviour discussed there simply had never occurred to me. Like... never once have I thought about 'promoting' my writing by going around and spamming random people with links to one of my books, essays, whatever.

I also... tend to be very hesistant to @ people I actually speak with when I'm trying to get something boosted. I can only think of one or two cases where I've specifically done this (and I'm pretty sure I was doing fundraising for someone who isn't me). Fuck. It can make me uncomfortable when I'm fundraising for myself and someone else @'s someone to boost it where I can see. 

And. Yeah. I'm a writer. I do try to sell my writing so I can eat. So it isn't like this is some... trivial matter to me.

But. Anyway. What I really was thinking about is how we often talk about how being autistic can lead to awkward social situations or other faux pas but... What about when being autistic *saves* you from bad social behaviour? Like... Sometimes I read about etiquette and I look at some of the things that are considered poor manners and some of them are things I've never even thought about as an option for behaviour. I look at them and think, "omg. who would even *do* this? and *why*?".

I may not always know what 'good' social behaviour is... but there are some bad behaviours that simply pass me by because they are beyond my understand. And that's kind of cool.
