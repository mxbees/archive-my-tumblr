seeing a post going around (which i'm only not commenting on directly bc it appears to be localized to a specific community), about how ppl act 'tougher' or whatever online than they would offline.

its weird to me that ppl just don't think about *why* this might be the case.

gee. i wonder why some ppl might not feel empowered or able to call out every act of micro/aggression directed at them irl.

i wonder what it is about online spaces that allows ppl to feel more empowered to assert their humanity.

i wonder.
