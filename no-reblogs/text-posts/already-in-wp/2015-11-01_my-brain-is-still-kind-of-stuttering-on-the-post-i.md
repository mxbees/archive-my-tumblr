my brain is still kind of stuttering on the post i made yesterday about disability, class, and survival (in response to an ask).

it feels important. that i think i truly and finally understand what one of the big disconnects bw me and teh ~disability community~ and/or middle class+ ppl. 

finally understanding just how different our relative positions are. that disconnect bw the 'why won't ppl acknowledge unhealthy coping" and my flat response "who cares".

and isn't about who is more disabled or even the most poor. the thing that constantly frustrates me about both class and ability, atm, is how they (and other things too) slowly but surely erode the number of available choices you can pick. its the frustration of knowing that some things could be easier, better, or just plain less hard but always having those same things just......

out of reach.

i don't think ppl understand that i want to live in a world where we can all seek treatment and/or have unhealthy coping mechanism but STILL be treated with dignity, respect, and humanity.
