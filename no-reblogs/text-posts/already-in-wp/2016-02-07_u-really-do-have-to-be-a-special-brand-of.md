u really do have to be a special brand of disgusting asshole misogynoir shithead to try and offload one of our own

who absolutely did something disgusting and horrible and entirely emblematic of asian antiBlackness

onto white ppl bc he's mixed and 'doesn't know anything about Asia'

as if that is actually a meaningful statement.

what does it mean to 'know something about Asia'? how much must u know about this vastly diverse geographic region and/or race to qualify as 'asian' enough?

are we also suddenly pretending that a goodly portion of us don't glorify half-white mixes (like me) as being the 'bestest' and most 'beautifullest' types of asians around? 

ppl like me. and ppl like hortzclaw are literally vastly over-represented in asian media. 

do you know how many mixed-with-white asians i've known who strategically mobilize either our proximity to whiteness or our racial minority status as a means to dodge all sorts of accountability? 

super easy to just... disavow hortzclaw bc he's a disgusting human being. are you doing the same for darren criss? bc i see asians all over the place super happy and willing to call him one of our own. and this is true for a lot of mixed-with-white asians who are also disproportionately represented in white media.

unless ur disavowing all of them and not holding them up as 'representation', its super interesting that all of a sudden hortzclaw isn't asian enough bc he's a reprehensible human being.

but really.

it isn't that easy. we can't just wash our hands and pretend like he isn't a product of our own culture as much as white culture.

it certainly was his not-at-all-mixed Japanese mom smiling on his legal defense fundraising campaign.

like it or not, this is us.
