i don't think it'll ever stop being such super fun thing to see whites continuously attempt to frame class as equivalent to race (or sometimes worse).

like i get why they are so invested in this line of argument...

but. god. i get tired of it.

like reading that one professor at harvard who swore that poor white ppl were the most disadvantaged when it came to admissions.

anyway. i hate u all.
