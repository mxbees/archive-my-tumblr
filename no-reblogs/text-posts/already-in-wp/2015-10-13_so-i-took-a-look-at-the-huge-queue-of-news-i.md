so i took a look at the huge queue of news i haven't been reading and read a few things (didn't have the energy to write summaries, though, sorry.)

and... of course i see an article by a enby of colour -- also dmab -- who is talking about how the recent trans visibility isn't helping enbies like them (or perhaps me, idk).

bc apparently only cis-blending, thin, conventionally attractive, binary people are getting attention or whatever. and that this media visibility isn't helping ppl like them.

whats fascinating is that i figured out the writer just by the first sentence. and it is, unsurprisingly, a person whose been called out for anti-Blackness before and... still really hasn't done a single thing to address this.

now. the article makes an explicit reference to Laverne Cox's times cover where it said we were experiencing a transgender tipping point or whatever.

i can only surmise from this that they are including Ms. Cox in this pronouncement that trans visibility isn't really helping 'visibly gender non-conforming' people like themselves.

its an interesting sleight of hand that depends on anti-Blackness bc Ms. Cox has said on _several_ occasions that she is regularly clocked as being trans. while, sure, she might have a 'binary' gender presentation, this doesn't, in fact, mean that she is suddenly not a 'visibly gender non-conforming' trans person.

anyway. this is a good example of why i don't talk to a lot of enbies. even ones of colour. bc... this? is still bullshit.
