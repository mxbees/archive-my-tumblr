ok. ppl might recall that i read trans-related news everyday. i haven't had the energy to write the short summaries. but i'm still reading the news.

ppl might recall that a white autistic trans man was killed by the police this year. it received a lot of press. its still receiving press.

this wouldn't bother me if not for the fact that i literally spent *months* last year constantly asking why few mainstream media outlets were counting Mya Hall amongst the twoc who were killed last year. only after months of me asking this, did *some* people start mentioning her. and most still don't.

the argument then appeared to be that bc Mya Hall was killed by the ~authorities~ she shouldn't be listed amongst the others who were murdered. 

can anyone tell me why Kayden Clark gets to be listed amongst the Black and Latina trans women murdered this year? but Mya Hall wasn't last year?

gosh. i wonder what the reason could be.....??????
