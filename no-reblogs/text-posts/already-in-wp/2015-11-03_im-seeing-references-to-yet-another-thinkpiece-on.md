i'm seeing references to Yet Another Thinkpiece On Why Trigger Warnings Are Ruining Higher Education(tm)

as [an antidote, i recommend everyone read Sarah Ahmed's "Against Students"][1] its fucking brilliant utterly destroys the moral panice about trigger warnings

i'm only commenting now to mention my favourite contradiction in all of these pieces. i work in higher ed and so i tend to keep somewhat current in terms of news, trends, and commentary.

the article i'm seeing referenced appears to claim that students' frontal lobes aren't fully developed, thus they should listen to their Wise Professor about What's Good For Them.

ok.

more frequently, though, i read thinkpieces on How Higher Ed is Businessfied and Students Can't Think Critically Anymore.

i love that ppl are panicking about both of these things at the same time. we have one group saying that students are too young to think for themselves and the same group (bc it is always 'progressive' academics who write this shit) saying that kids these days can't think critically.

anyway, fuck academia.
