it really is exhausting when u learn enough and have thought through enough things to realize that many of the randon ppl you encounter are still thinking of maybe taking the bus and approaching the starting line.

example: "here's my generic, radical enby statement that u don't have to live by the binary! revolution!"

me: "but really, can we fucking talk about trans women and intimate partner violence or...?"

i. am. exhausted.
